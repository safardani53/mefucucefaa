well-known bishop who, "early in his ministry," was "considered a rising star on the Pentecostal preaching circuit," per the <a aria-label="AP News (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Associated Press</a>.</p><p>He was often featured on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, which brought him to an international audience, according to the outlet.</p><p>After beginning a ministry in 1977, Carlton founded Higher Dimensions <a href=#>Family</a> Church — which was later renamed to New Dimensions Church — in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1981, and it gained about 6,000 members.</p><p>However, according to the outlet, he faced controversy when he started teaching what he referred to as "the gospel of inclusion," a form of universalism, which does not recognize hell.</p><p>His church's membership decreased to a few hundred people by 2008.</p><p>In 2007, Carlton "helped lead hundreds of clergy members" from across the <a href=#>US</a> in advocating for <a href=#>Congress</a> to pass "landmark hate crime and job discrimination measures for gay people."</p><p>The Associated Press states that he "was shunned by other evangelical leaders, branded a heretic and later became a United Church of Christ minister."</p><p>Higher Dimensions' building was later foreclosed, and Carlton preached his last sermon there&nbsp;in September 2008 "as the church was absorbed into All Souls Unitarian Church in Tulsa."</p><p>His story was then told in an episode of public <a href=#>radio’s</a> This American Life, which inspired the 2018 <a href=#>Netflix</a> <a href=#>film</a>, Come Sunday.</p><p>According to famous-christians.com, Carlton was also "an accomplished singer" who had record deals with Atlantic Records, Tommy Boy Records, and Warner Bros.</p><p>Carlton <a href=#>died</a> on Sunday, November 19, 2023, at the age of 70 after a battle with <a href=#>cancer</a>.</p><p>A Facebook <a href=# aria-label="post shared on his account (opens
