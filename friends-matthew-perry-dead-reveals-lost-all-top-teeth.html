He told People: “I didn’t know how to stop.</p><p>“If the police came over to my house and said, ‘If you drink tonight, we’re going to take you to jail’, I’d start packing.</p><p>“I couldn’t stop because the disease and the addiction are progressive.

It’s like penguins. Penguins, in nature, when one is sick, or when one is very injured, the other penguins surround it and prop it up.</p><p>“They walk around it until that penguin can walk on its own.
