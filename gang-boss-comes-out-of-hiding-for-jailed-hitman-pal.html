The Lyons crew were brainwashed into thinking Billy would walk free and everything would return to normal.</p><p>“But it was a complete fairytale and reality hit hard when he got jailed.</p><p>“One of Billy’s relatives is openly bad-mouthing and blaming the Lyons for what happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2402490.main_image.jpg><p>“Steven is trying to find a way of repairing the damage — but the fact that he’s not visited Billy in prison says it all.</p><p>“It may be that he’s been told he’s not welcome.”</p><p>We found Lyons, 34, in Cumbernauld last week as he visited associates.</p><p>He fled to Spain after he was wounded in the bloodbath garage attack in 2006.<br>Hitmen from the rival Daniel gang shot him at his uncle David’s Applerow<br>Motors MOT station in Lambhill, Glasgow.</p><p>Doctors removed part of a bullet from his back and his leg was in plaster for 12 weeks.</p><p>His cousin Michael Lyons, 21, was killed, while family enforcer Robert Pickett was also injured.</p><p>It was the most shocking eruption of violence in a decade-long war between the rival crime clans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2402493.main_image.jpg><p>Killers Raymond Anderson, 53, and James McDonald, 41, who used stolen British Army guns for the hit, were later caged for 30 years.</p><p>And Steven Lyons was last seen in Scotland when he returned from Spain in 2008 to give evidence at their trial.</p><p>He was joined in Spain by Paterson, 35, after the gunman blasted feared Daniel mob enforcer Carroll outside an Asda supermarket in Robroyston, Glasgow, in 2010.</p><p>Lyons and on-the-run Paterson partied together in Marbella and mixed with wealthy crime bosses from around the world.</p><p>We told last month how Lyons forged an alliance with Irish godfather Christy<br>Kinahan, known as the ‘Dapper Don’ and one of Europe’s most powerful gangsters.</p><p>He is also in a relationship with the daughter of Ricky Hayes, a major Glasgow&nbsp; crook who is based on the Costa del Sol.</p><p>The source said: “Steven was not only physically injured in the MOT shooting, he was also very badly shaken up.</p><p>“Some people say his bottle went when he decided to go to Spain, but he made some very useful, high-level contacts out there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2402494.main_image.jpg><p>“When Gerbil was killed by Paterson it took the pressure off, but he still felt a lot safer in Spain than in Scotland.”</p><p>Paterson was eventually forced to go underground after police in Scotland&nbsp; launched a high-profile campaign to snare him.</p><p>He finally gave himself up and agreed to return to the UK to face the charges.<br>We revealed how he only handed himself in because he had secretly fathered a child during almost five years on the run.</p><p>He bragged to cops that he would beat the rap — and his Lyons gang cronies expected him to walk free.</p><p>But he was caged at the High Court in Glasgow for at least 22 years after he was convicted of executing Carroll, 29.</p><p>Fellow Lyons associate Ross Monaghan, 33, previously stood trial for the killing but the 2012 case against him collapsed.</p><p>A change in double jeopardy laws means Monaghan, of Pennilee, Glasgow, could be retried if new evidence emerges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2402495.main_image.jpg><p>Sources claim he is also unhappy with the Lyons clan because of Paterson’s jailing — and the risk that he could join him behind bars in the future. The pair have been friends since childhood and as teenagers were both members of<br>the Club Boys gang, whose HQ was Chirnsyde youth club, run by Lyons’ dad Eddie Lyons Snr, 57.</p><p>Since Paterson was jailed, campaigning local councillor Billy McAllister has called for a public inquiry into how it became a breeding ground for one of Scotland’s most dangerous crime gangs.</p><p>The club in Glasgow’s Milton was backed by police, Glasgow City Council and the Labour Party.</p><p>Another source revealed: “Eddie Snr was a father figure to many of these young boys, including Billy.</p><p>“Many of these kids were vulnerable and became ultra-loyal to the Lyons, even doing time for them for drugs and violence. From an early age they were drawn into a life of increasingly serious crime.</p><p>“But it was always them who took the fall — not the Lyons.</p><p>“Billy won’t see his child grow up and will be almost 70 before he can apply for parole, while Steven is a free man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2402487.main_image.jpg><p>“He doesn’t deserve any sympathy, but he is paying a huge price for the Lyons gang’s war with the Daniels. There’s a lot of bitterness, resentment and confusion.</p><p>“Monaghan is also angry as he’s living constantly with the threat he could be tried again.</p><p>“It seems likely that the damage is irreparable and the Lyons mob will split for good.</p><p>“If that happens, Steven will probably return to Spain.”</p><h2>DECADE OF VIOLENCE</h2><p>STEVEN Lyons was aged just 20 when a gunman opened fire at him outside a pub.</p><p>He was not hit in the attack at Mallon’s bar in Lambhill, Glasgow — but they were the first shots in what became a decade-long war between the Lyons and Daniel gangs.</p><p>The feud began when stolen Daniel cocaine fell into the hands of the Lyons’ Club Boys gang.</p><p>What followed were years of tit-for-tat beatings, slashings, fire attacks and shootings which ended with the 2010 assassination of Daniel enforcer Kevin ‘Gerbil’ Carroll, 29, outside a supermarket in Robroyston.</p><p>Carroll had sparked revulsion when he desecrated the grave of Steven’s brother Garry who died of cancer aged eight.</p><h2>LYONS MOB: A WHO’S WHO</h2><p><b>STEVEN LYONS</b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
