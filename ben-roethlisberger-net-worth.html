On August 3, 2004, he made a 6-year $22.26 million contract with Pittsburgh, with a $600K signing bonus and a $3.7 million average salary.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, in 2008, he signed a 6-year $87.9 million extension deal and 4 years $87.4 million extension deal in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ben_Roethlisberger_2020-scaled.jpg><p>With the end of the contract, in 2019, he signed a new $68 million extension with the Steelers, which included a $37 million signing bonus.</p><p>Roethlisberger converted $19.5 million of his 2020 salary & bonus to a signing bonus, allowing the Steelers to clear $9.5 million in cap space.</p><p>Hence, his two-year contract extension with the Steelers became the athlete’s highest-ever contract, rendering him the second-highest-paid NFL star in 2019.</p><p>It was a two-year deal that ended in 2021, and he re-signed with the team for one year for $14 million and concluded his career.&nbsp;</p><h2>Endorsements</h2><p>In addition to his accomplishments on the field, Roethlisberger is well-known for the various brands he endorses, including Nike, Sprint, Panini, Fanatics, and Upper Deck.&nbsp;</p><p>Ben’s annual earnings range from $1 to $3 million due to the sales of all the products he endorses.

The athlete was inspired by former Broncos quarterback John Elway and wore the number 7 as a nod to his hero.</p><p>Ben went on to become the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl in NFL history at the age of 23.</p><p>Moreover, he led the Steelers to two Super Bowl victories, the first over the NFC Seattle Seahawks in 2005 and the second against the NFC Arizona Cardinals in 2008.</p><p>Aside from two Super Bowl victories, Benjamin was named to six Pro Bowls. The athlete hunged his boots in 2022, retiring from his professional career.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ben Roethlisberger’s Quotes</h2><ul><li><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“I try to live my life as my father lives his.
