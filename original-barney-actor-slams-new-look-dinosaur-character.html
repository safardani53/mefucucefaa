I wish them the best because this new generation love animation and of course, like anything in entertainment, it has to evolve.</p><p>“You have to evolve for the new generations.</p><p>“I'm anxious and curious to see how it's going to look when it's moving.”</p><p>David auditioned for the role of Barney in 1991 and, at first, didn’t land it.</p><p>But he says that everything that came before in his life meant that he was destined to play the character.</p><p>Speaking about the audition process, he said: “I was so athletic and energetic, they weren't used to that, so I didn't get the part after about five or so auditions.</p><p>“But one thing that was really significant was that when I was about seven years old, I used to stand in front of a TV and lip sync.</p><p>“Growing up, it became a party thing.</p><p>“I'd walk into a party and they'd say, ‘Dave, do your thing.’</p><p>“And I'd look at someone, study their mannerisms and I'd say, ‘Okay, now I'm gonna turn around and you start talking and I'm gonna be your body.’”</p><p>David was able to bring his party trick to the table when he got under the Barney costume.</p><p>He said: “In one of the auditions, they wanted us to do some improv.</p><p>“The guy who did the voice, Bob West, was there and he was doing the voice as we were doing the acting with the script.</p><p>“We started doing improv and I started moving the mouth exactly to what he was saying.</p><p>“They were all freaking out and the performance director came over to me and said, ‘How are you doing that?’</p><p>“And I said, ‘Oh, it's this thing I started doing when I was a kid.’<br>“They thought it was pretty fascinating, but they ended up giving the part to a woman and asked me to be backup.</p><p>“She did one line of appearance and it didn't work out, so they contacted me, and we negotiated and got everything ironed out.”</p><p>David had two other skills which would come in handy as he transformed himself into Barney - including a knowledge of the esoteric traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism known as tantra.</p><p>He said: “When I was 19, I started studying tantra and I went to school for electronic engineering technology.</p><p>“I've always understood energy - energy of components, energy of electricity, energy of people.</p><p>“What I wanted to do is just radiate loving energy through the costume constantly.</p><p>“With the fundamentals of tantra, you pull up the energy from your kundalini and you expand your chi energy and it's almost like recirculating a battery.</p><p>“The costume being 70 pounds, it could get to over 120 degrees, but I could still stay in the costume for long periods of times.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“And also, being a drummer from the age of six meant I was able to move different parts of my body at the same time. That also helped.</p><p>“It was no accident that I was Barney.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/actor-david-joyner-attends-american-797306375.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/NINTCHDBPICT000797308477.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZGmDdH%2BSaKaroZeeu6K4jJuYq6aVrnqir9OoqWarnJa6tHnNnq5mpJ%2BkuG6wyKemrJmlp3qktMCrmJyslad8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2foriginal-barney-actor-slams-new-look-dinosaur-character.html&text=Original%20Barney%20actor%20David%20Joyner%20slams%20reboot%27s%20new%20look%20with%20biting%20verdict%20on%20%27mischievous%27%203D%20c&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foriginal-barney-actor-slams-new-look-dinosaur-character.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2foriginal-barney-actor-slams-new-look-dinosaur-character.html&title=Original%20Barney%20actor%20David%20Joyner%20slams%20reboot%27s%20new%20look%20with%20biting%20verdict%20on%20%27mischievous%27%203D%20c" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2foriginal-barney-actor-slams-new-look-dinosaur-character.html&title=Original%20Barney%20actor%20David%20Joyner%20slams%20reboot%27s%20new%20look%20with%20biting%20verdict%20on%20%27mischievous%27%203D%20c" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2foriginal-barney-actor-slams-new-look-dinosaur-character.html&title=Original%20Barney%20actor%20David%20Joyner%20slams%20reboot%27s%20new%20look%20with%20biting%20verdict%20on%20%27mischievous%27%203D%20c" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foriginal-barney-actor-slams-new-look-dinosaur-character.html&description=Original%20Barney%20actor%20David%20Joyner%20slams%20reboot%27s%20new%20look%20with%20biting%20verdict%20on%20%27mischievous%27%203D%20c" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ti-serenades-tiny-harris-karaoke-birthday-watch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="T.I.
