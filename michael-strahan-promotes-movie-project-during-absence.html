They were blown out. A lot of stuff happened."</p><p>"Come to find out, maybe it wasn't a real school. Hmm. you got to see the documentary to find out whether it's true or not."</p><p>Michael's new clip showed off a bit of what viewers can expect from the film.</p><p>He captioned his video: "Did he think he was doing right or did he know he was doing wrong? You be the judge!</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON MICHAEL STRAHAN">READ MORE ON MICHAEL STRAHAN</h2><p>"Watch #BSHigh TONIGHT at 9 PM on @hbo and @streamonmax! @smacentertainment @conschwartz."</p><p>Though Michael was active sharing his film on social media, however, he has remained absent from his GMA post.</p><p>It's likely he's still coming back from dropping off daughters Isabella and Sophia, 18, at their respective colleges.</p><p>He hasn't indicated when he'll be returning to the show just yet.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>'SO IRRITATING!'</h2><p>Meanwhile, GMA fans were <a href=#>left divided</a> over a small detail in Michael Strahan's latest Instagram post.</p><p>The beloved broadcaster and NFL Hall of Famer, 51, gave an update on his personal life on Monday as he helped his youngest daughter move into college.</p><p>In the series of snaps posted by the former&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Giant</a>, Strahan headed for Duke University with Sophia ahead of her move.</p><p>During his visit, the two toured the campus, enjoyed some local barbecue, and headed for&nbsp;<a href=#>Target</a>&nbsp;to stock up on the essentials.</p><p>"Dropped off the youngest of the tribe&nbsp;@sophialstrahan&nbsp;at college!" Strahan wrote.</p><p>"Can't believe how time has flown by and I’m so proud of her. I know she’s going to crush college life!!&nbsp;#DukeDad"</p><p>However, while most of the comments that followed consisted simply of well-wishers, fans, and fellow parents having also endured the typical college move-in Target run, some were left questioning why Strahan had been allowed to bring his dog Enzo into the store.</p><p>One comment read: "Pretty young lady, have a successful college year!</p><p>"On another note, I hate when people bring their dog in a store or restaurant!</p><p>"If it's not a service dog, then they ... should be not allowed!! Like wtf, leave your pets at home!! So irritating!!"</p><p>A second asked: "Why is the dog in a store?"</p><p>As a further fan joked: "Most dogs are better behaved than people."</p><p>Target technically does not allow dogs in their stores, with service dogs being the exception, as per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogoday</a>.</p><p>Strahan regularly posts sweet pics of his four-legged friend on Instagram.</p><p>Most recently, he took Enzo with him for lunch, although it seems the pup was less excited than Strahan.</p><p>"Lunch with Enzo! He is really talkative. LOLOL," Strahan captioned the pics which showed him beaming alongside a sleeping Enzo.</p><h2>HEADING WEST</h2><p>On Wednesday, Michael <a href=#>subtly revealed</a> his whereabouts in a new post as he remains absent from Good Morning America.</p><p>He recently dropped his daughter, Sophia, off to college.</p><p><a href=#>Michael</a>, 51, has been absent from&nbsp;<a href=#>GMA</a>, which films in&nbsp;<a href=#>New York City</a>, this whole week.</p><p><a href=#>Linsey Davis</a>&nbsp;has been filling in for him this week.</p><p>Michael explained to his followers where he is and why he is not currently on the show with a subtle picture.</p><p>On Tuesday, he posted a photo to his&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram&nbsp;</a>story in which he was driving near Fairfax Avenue in&nbsp;<a href=#>Los Angeles</a>&nbsp;when he saw a billboard for the show, BS High.</p><p>Just a few hours later, his daughter,&nbsp;<a href=#>Isabella</a>, 18, posted a photo to her story.</p><p>"Last night," she captioned the post.</p><p>She was at a Drake concert in&nbsp;<a href=#>California</a>, and the person he brought on stage wore a Los Angeles Lakers jersey.</p><p>Isabella is starting her freshmen year at the University of Southern California.</p><p>According to the USC calendar, classes began August 21.</p><h2>TIME FLIES!</h2><p>Just a few days prior, Michael traveled to Durham, North Carolina, to&nbsp;<a href=#>drop off his other daughter</a>, Sophia, 18, to college.</p><p>She is a freshmen at Duke University.</p><p>Michael captioned his photos: "Dropped off the youngest of the tribe @sophialstrahan at college! Can’t believe how time has flown by and I’m so proud of her. I know she’s going to crush college life!! #DukeDad"</p><p>He also added: "I know she’s a twin so @isabellastrahan pics coming soon! Lol"</p><p>He grinned alongside Sophia as the pair posed in front of the school, a restaurant, and in Target.</p><p>They spent some time shopping for the essentials Sophia would need to get started at school.</p><p>Although orientation started over the weekend for Duke students, they do not&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">begin classes until the 28th</a>.</p><h2>MAKING MOVES</h2><p>Michael has been absent from the morning show, but he's been promoting his other business ventures.</p><p>While still away from the show, the 51-year-old shared a photo of himself in a button-down shirt to his Instagram Stories.</p><p>He captioned the photo: "Raise your shirt game with our latest styles @mooresclothing."</p><p>Moores is a retailer that sells some of Michael Strahan's&nbsp;<a href=#>clothing line</a>.</p><p>In the photo, Michael wore one of his Modern Fit 4-Way Stretch shirts.</p><p>He added the hashtag "#RaiseYourGame" to the post featuring himself posing in the shirt.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The shirt is available in myriad colors and print designs.</p><p>It is not clear when Michael will return to GMA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/esc-robin-roberts-1jpg-JS825977465.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/GYI1251556263jpg-JS809234709.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/08/msemail_NA-BS_High-01jpeg-JS839876283.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwaWaFeX6YaKSim5iWsq150q2pmqCRo3qxvs6mpq2do2K6sMLInmSpqp%2BfsqTAjJ2sq6GenHqirtKepZydXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-strahan-promotes-movie-project-during-absence.html&text=Michael%20Strahan%20promotes%20new%20movie%20project%20as%20he%20remains%20missing%20from%20morning%20show%20during%20break%20in%20L&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-strahan-promotes-movie-project-during-absence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-strahan-promotes-movie-project-during-absence.html&title=Michael%20Strahan%20promotes%20new%20movie%20project%20as%20he%20remains%20missing%20from%20morning%20show%20during%20break%20in%20L" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-strahan-promotes-movie-project-during-absence.html&title=Michael%20Strahan%20promotes%20new%20movie%20project%20as%20he%20remains%20missing%20from%20morning%20show%20during%20break%20in%20L" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-strahan-promotes-movie-project-during-absence.html&title=Michael%20Strahan%20promotes%20new%20movie%20project%20as%20he%20remains%20missing%20from%20morning%20show%20during%20break%20in%20L" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-strahan-promotes-movie-project-during-absence.html&description=Michael%20Strahan%20promotes%20new%20movie%20project%20as%20he%20remains%20missing%20from%20morning%20show%20during%20break%20in%20L" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./elle-macpherson-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos Of The Australian Supermodel  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mark-warburton-nottingham-forest-manager-rangers-frank-mcparland.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mark Warburton could be offered Nottingham Forest job as club want ex-Rangers colleague Frank McParl">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
