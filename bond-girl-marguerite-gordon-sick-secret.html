I just let it pass and I could not be bothered to speak publicly.</p><p>"It was brave of me to stop him assaulting me, and I am not sure anyone had treated him like that before.</p><p>"I did not have any desire to get into the movies, my future lay in the airline industry and I was too busy to do anything.</p><p>"I know there is a MeToo movement and I was so damn mad at him and upset about that.</p><h2>'UGLY SITUATION'</h2><p>"I got annoyed that he changed the voice of the Chung character, but I decided what was the point?</p><p>"It was such an ugly situation especially as the man had been so nice before.</p><p>"I really couldn't be bothered to speak up. I didn't regard Hollywood as the holy grail."</p><p>While, she felt empowered to act against Young, but has sympathy for other&nbsp;actresses, who did succumb to advances from Hollywood tyrants.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>“I was twenty two years old and when I read after all these years that you have the Me Too movement, especially in America, where the young girls have been treated very badly that way by directors and people," she said.</p><p>“It’s the family strength and therefore, family is very important. And Jamaica was very eager about the film. I have never been invited to any Royal premieres."</p><p>Gordon, who is promoting her third novel Empires of The Caribbean , made history as the first female Bond villain - Dr. No's photographer, Annabel Chung.</p><p>Today, after being effectively forgotten by Bond executives for 60 years, she said would welcome returning for a walk on part or writing role.</p><p>"I would be honored to come back," she said.</p><p>"I think it is time for producers to look at a non white Bond."</p><span class=quote-credit>Marguerite Gordon</span><p>Gordon, who lives in Trinidad and Tobago, also told how she hopes stars like Idris Elba and Daniel Kaluuya will be considered for the iconic role, as long "as they are the best fit"</p><p>"I think it is time for producers to look at a non white Bond," she said.</p><p>"My kind of Jamaican, we don't look at things as black and white. It is about class. We look at the star's screen presence, whether he speaks correctly, is a gentleman and charisma. And he has to be sexy.</p><p>"The color doesn't matter to me."</p><h2>NO TO FEMALE 007</h2><p>"I have no problem with them being non white, but i just don't want to make it a woman.</p><p>"They should stick to writer Ian Fleming's character.</p><p>"As a woman I am all about pushing forward women all the time to get better. But I cannot see a woman in the role of what is expected of James Bond. Is she going to jump in bed with a lot of men? I don't like that.</p><p>"Bond has to be violent. I would not like to see a woman behave like Bond. There are modes of violence, but I do not know that it would behove a woman."</p><h2>BEST BOND</h2><p>She cites Connery as the greatest ever 007, with only Daniel Craig coming close to the true character.</p><p>"Sean was extremely important to making Bond.</p><p>"He set a high standard. He treated me so well and was debonair, handsome and possessed this dangerous quality and humanness.</p><p>"Daniel was good, because he brought the edgy side of Bond back. Like Sean he was very sexy</p><p>"I didn't like George Lazenby at all. I have nothing against Australians, but he was not debonair and didn't have the spirit.</p><p>"Roger Moore I liked on screen, but was a little bit too soft</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Timothy Dalton tried to be like Sean, but didn't achieve the gentlemanly qualities</p><p>"I did not like Pierce Brosnan at all. I felt like he was acting the whole time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huY25%2Fd4CSaJmoppRitKq%2By2akmqqXqrKztdOeZKCnopm8r3nSopqkZaOasLOx02g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbond-girl-marguerite-gordon-sick-secret.html&text=Bond%20girl%20Marguerite%20Gordon%20reveals%20who%20should%20be%20the%20next%20007%20as%20she%20opens%20up%20about%20sick%20secret%20she&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbond-girl-marguerite-gordon-sick-secret.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbond-girl-marguerite-gordon-sick-secret.html&title=Bond%20girl%20Marguerite%20Gordon%20reveals%20who%20should%20be%20the%20next%20007%20as%20she%20opens%20up%20about%20sick%20secret%20she" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbond-girl-marguerite-gordon-sick-secret.html&title=Bond%20girl%20Marguerite%20Gordon%20reveals%20who%20should%20be%20the%20next%20007%20as%20she%20opens%20up%20about%20sick%20secret%20she" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbond-girl-marguerite-gordon-sick-secret.html&title=Bond%20girl%20Marguerite%20Gordon%20reveals%20who%20should%20be%20the%20next%20007%20as%20she%20opens%20up%20about%20sick%20secret%20she" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbond-girl-marguerite-gordon-sick-secret.html&description=Bond%20girl%20Marguerite%20Gordon%20reveals%20who%20should%20be%20the%20next%20007%20as%20she%20opens%20up%20about%20sick%20secret%20she" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dancing-on-ices-jason-donovan-carrying-heavy-bags.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dancing On Ice casualty Jason Donovan is seen carrying heavy shopping bags after injuring back and q">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lily-tomlin-pictures-married-jane-wagner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="[PICS] Lily Tomlins Married  Newly Married Actress Through The Years  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
