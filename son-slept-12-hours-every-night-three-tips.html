It's so nice & we are so similar things that you did! Just went to Hawaii for a week & he slept perfectly!”</p><p>A second said: “I have five kids, including twins. Sleep trained all of them. All slept 10-12 hrs by 12-16 weeks. It is possible.”</p><p>Although not all were fans, with one parent commenting: “Ridiculous. So dangerous, goes against all safe sleeping. Poor baby.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Another said: “90% of this is baby temperament.”</p><p>Someone else put: “My daughter is 30 months and has always slept like a rock. I’m sure the book is good and you & I are great parents… but, really, we just got lucky.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FqaHJsZGWAcL%2FOp2SspJWlwW59kWafqK2iqHqmwsSrsGammZy1tXnToamenV2ptrG%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fson-slept-12-hours-every-night-three-tips.html&text=My%2010-week-old%20son%20slept%2012%20hours%20every%20night%20-%20here%27s%20my%20three%20tips%20for%20getting%20your%20kid%20to%20go%20thro&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fson-slept-12-hours-every-night-three-tips.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fson-slept-12-hours-every-night-three-tips.html&title=My%2010-week-old%20son%20slept%2012%20hours%20every%20night%20-%20here%27s%20my%20three%20tips%20for%20getting%20your%20kid%20to%20go%20thro" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fson-slept-12-hours-every-night-three-tips.html&title=My%2010-week-old%20son%20slept%2012%20hours%20every%20night%20-%20here%27s%20my%20three%20tips%20for%20getting%20your%20kid%20to%20go%20thro" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fson-slept-12-hours-every-night-three-tips.html&title=My%2010-week-old%20son%20slept%2012%20hours%20every%20night%20-%20here%27s%20my%20three%20tips%20for%20getting%20your%20kid%20to%20go%20thro" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fson-slept-12-hours-every-night-three-tips.html&description=My%2010-week-old%20son%20slept%2012%20hours%20every%20night%20-%20here%27s%20my%20three%20tips%20for%20getting%20your%20kid%20to%20go%20thro" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-brad-imes-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Brad Imes Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./daisy-ridley-sister-siblings-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Daisy Ridleys Siblings  One Sister Is a Spiritual Healer Another a Model">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
