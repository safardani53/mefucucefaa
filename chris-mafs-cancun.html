When he told his wife about this on the show, she took the news in stride, and she commended him on his strength.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though things might be going well (at the moment) for Paige and Chris on MAFS, he's allegedly been spotted in Cancun with his ex-fiancée.

While Paige and Chris were celebrating their honeymoon in Las Vegas, he learned that he was expecting a baby with his ex-fiancée, Mercedes Myrick.</p><p>After declaring that he needed to deal with some "devastating" news on his own, Chris eventually told his wife.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Later on, he shared the news with the four other couples.&nbsp;"I found out some disturbing news today," Chris shared before Paige told him that "disturbing" wasn't the right word.

The two got engaged in February of 2020, and they spent time quarantining together as well. There's some evidence to suggest that they were together in late June of 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris swapped vows with Paige in August.
