And if you don't know the answer to a question, just be honest about it."</p><p>Marisa and Teddie, both 25, entered the <a href=#>Den</a> asking for £50,000 for a five per cent stake in their business.</p><p>Beginning the pitch, Marisa, who is originally from <a href=#>New York</a>, said: "For years I’ve struggled with ADHD and anxiety, which was particularly challenging while studying at university in the US.</p><p>"I would consume copious amounts of coffee and energy drinks to help me get through the long study days.</p><p>"But the caffeine gave me jitters, crashes and exacerbated by anxiety symptoms.</p><p>"That’s when I discovered matcha - a powdered Japanese green tea that offers slow-release energy.</p><p>"I was hooked, so naturally I recommended it to everyone, including Teddie who at the time was studying to go to law school."</p><p>I’m thrilled to support this incredible product and its visionary creators.</p><span class=quote-credit>Steven Bartlett</span><p>Teddie, from Hampstead, north-west London, added: "We found a massive barrier for people switching to matcha was its umami flavour and the time it took to prepare.</p><p>"So, when Marisa moved to London last year, we quit our jobs in finance and created an on-the-go solution – the UK’s first matcha-powered energy drinks flavoured with real fruit, so that everyone else could feel as amazing as we did.</p><p>"Our drinks will keep you energised for twice as long, improve your focus and give you the antioxidants you need to look as young as Steven."</p><p>At this point, the Dragons erupted into laughter and the pair knew they were on to a winner.</p><p>They went on to explain how in just seven months their products landed on the shelves of 450 Holland & Barrett branches nationwide, as well as Planet Organic and several grocery stores in the US.</p><p>They then offered the drinks round for a tasting before delving into their finances - explaining that they had already raised an investment of £245,000 through director and family loans.</p><p>Four Dragons offered all the money in exchange for 10 per cent of the business, but <a href=#>Deborah Meaden</a> quickly undercut her rivals by proposing £50,000 for 7.5 per cent.</p><p>PerfectTed eventually accepted the full amount for 10 per cent, split between Steven and Peter.</p><h2>SUCCESS STORY</h2><p>Diary of a CEO podcast host Steven said: "Once in a while you have entrepreneurs come into the Den that you just have a huge degree of admiration for, and the journey you’re on as young entrepreneurs is a similar journey that I’ve been on as well.</p><p>"I’m thrilled to support this incredible product and its visionary creators as they revolutionise the beverage industry with their unique blend of matcha and energy-boosting ingredients.</p><p>"PerfectTed is more than just a drink, it's a symbol of what can be achieved with creativity, determination, and a willingness to take risks.</p><p>"I am excited to see where this journey takes them and proud to be a part of their success story."</p><p>Housemates Marisa, Teddie and Levi came up with the idea for PerfectTed while working long hours before officially launching last year.</p><p>Marisa said: "We’re all best friends - the boys are brothers and Levi is my partner…. It’s like an episode of Friends."</p><p>They would batch-make big jugs of matcha to get them through busy periods before realising there must be a better way.</p><p>The few matcha powders and drinks on the market that they tried tasted grassy and bitter, they said.</p><p>Or, if they were slightly more palatable, they were packed full of additives and sweeteners and used low-quality matcha.</p><p>After six months of obsessively sourcing sustainable, organic, ceremonial grade matcha from farms across Uji, <a href=#>Japan</a>, they finally met their match.</p><p>And by fusing it with fresh fruit juice and lightly sparkling water, they had <a href=# aria-label="PerfectTed (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">PerfectTed</a>, which is available in three flavours - pear ginger, apple raspberry and pineapple yuzu - in Tesco for £1.75.</p><p>Four-can multipacks for £6 will launch on March 13.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The products contain 80mg of caffeine - equivalent to a can of Red Bull or a small cup of coffee - but won't see your energy levels crash.</p><p>The name comes from Teddie being "perfect" growing up - head boy at school, a college athlete at the University of Pennsylvania and potential pro footballer, and securing a spot at Harvard Law.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7d41e163-7776-40f5-8567-6f21f6048ae1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/000-investment-businessman-steven-bartlett-801098829.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3ba9f8d6-5920-4ab5-80e6-c78fbc405a82.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpha355g5ZvZp2qkZy8r7%2BMnZynZaCewaS0jKidn52iqHqxsdGfnJyspJqxcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdragons-den-pitch-offers-perfectted.html&text=&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdragons-den-pitch-offers-perfectted.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdragons-den-pitch-offers-perfectted.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdragons-den-pitch-offers-perfectted.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdragons-den-pitch-offers-perfectted.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdragons-den-pitch-offers-perfectted.html&description=" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tamron-hall-talk-show-looks-season-five-fashion-exclusive-7967553.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All the Details Behind Tamron Hall's Season 5 Talk Show Looks">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-sharelle-rosado-chad-ocho-cinco-johnson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Chad 'Ocho Cinco' Johnson's Fiance?
