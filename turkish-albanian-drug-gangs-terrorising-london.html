be seen dancing and rapping around what appears to be piles of cocaine worth £80,000 a kilo.</p><p>In a sign of staggering confidence, the masked men sing about being local criminals — brazenly sharing the exact street where they filmed in Haringey, <a href=#>North London</a>.</p><p>This is the swaggering arrogance borne from an emerging alliance between <a href=#>Turkish</a> and Albanian gangs.</p><p>Hoods from both sides are seen rapping together online in a terrifying new bond between increasingly violent factions.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON CRIME">READ MORE ON CRIME</h2><p>Members of Albanian criminal gang Hellbanianz, in East London, are already notorious for flaunting their wealth and weaponry on social media — and now Turkish groups are following suit.</p><p>Campaigners last night said the displays are symbolic of just how confident foreign gangs have become that they will not be deported, as they watch Britain struggle with its migrant problem.</p><p><a href=#>Tory</a> MP Tim Loughton said: “This is yet more evidence of widespread organised criminal gangs, courtesy of the Albanians sticking two fingers up at the authorities and acting with impunity.</p><p>“They play a significant role in the <a href=#>drugs</a> and people-smuggling trade, coming into the UK from boats manufactured in Turkey or China.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fixer for smugglers</h2><p>“We’ve got to get real about exporting this crimewave back to

expense in jail, although they are being increasingly sent back home under a deal with their Government.”</p><p>Migration Watch UK chairman Alp Mehmet said the footage demonstrates how foreign gangs see <a href=#>Britain’s</a> justice system as “weak”.</p><p>He added: “This shows the pitiful state of UK border control and immigration enforcement.</p><p>“Our weak and outdated <a href=#>laws</a> and the treaties we adhere to, plus our permissive courts, make it only too easy for <a href=#>criminals</a> from any country to force their way into the UK knowing there’s little chance of being removed.”</p><p>Albanian kingpins are not only fuelling the UK’s drug problems, but many are behind people-smuggling operations in <a href=#>France</a>.</p><p>Last month, Ujeza Kurmekaj, 32, of Banbury, <a href=#>Oxfordshire</a>, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years for acting as a fixer for smugglers.</p><p>And in August, three Albanians and a Brit were sent down for a total of almost 19 years for arranging “dangerous” trips in small boats.</p><p>Jetmir Myrtaj, 35, Banet Tershana, 52, Klodian Shenaj, 49, and British national Desmond Rice, 47, of Aylesbury, <a href=#>Bucks</a>, were arrested in Belgium between and October last year and March.</p><p>At one point they tried to load 12 migrants, including a woman and child, on to a small boat in <a href=#>Belgium</a> with just six inadequate life jackets.</p><p>This week it was revealed that only one per cent of migrants who arrived in small boats across the <a href=#>English Channel</a> have been removed from Britain in the past three years — 1,182 out of nearly 110,000.</p><p>Of these, 762 were Albanians — equivalent to 0.7 per cent.</p><p>The number of arrivals from Albania has dropped hugely over the last year, as the result of a removals agreement signed with the Albanian Government by PM <a href=#>Rishi Sunak</a>.</p><p>It is credited with being a significant deterrent, but large numbers of Albanian men remain in the UK, creating big problems for authorities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hellbanianz_2JPG-JS448560768.jpg><p>More than 12,000 Albanians headed for Britain on small boats last year, representing one per cent of the Balkan country’s working-age men.</p><p>Those who arrived were sent to hotels while their asylum claims were dealt with, but a quarter are said to have absconded — many within days.</p><p>Now the UK is seeing an increase in Turkish migrants who, this year, accounted for one in nine people making the perilous journey across the English Channel.</p><p>Albanian criminals have made no pretence of hiding their luxury lifestyles as they wreak havoc peddling drugs across Britain.</p><p>The Hellbanianz street gang, based on East Barking’s Gascoigne Estate, is infamous for showing off <a href=#>luxury</a> cars, jewellery and armoured carriers mounted with machine guns.</p><p>Thugs are also known for posting rap videos and now their Turkish counterparts are doing the same, with some joining forces.</p><p>We found clips of rappers sharing the joint hashtags #turkeytiktok alongside #shqipetiktok and #albos.</p><p>The men pictured rapping in their <a href=#>Audi</a> shared the common hashtags.</p><p>The same account owner posted a clip of hooded rappers showing off a cocaine haul with the hashtag #turkishdrill.</p><p>A source told The Sun: “Major drug dealers in Turkey have historically relied heavily on Turkish-born Albanians to distribute their drugs in Europe.</p><p>“The nations share long-standing cultural and historical ties, so it was only a matter of time before they found each other in Britain.”</p><p>In a further sign of the growing collaboration between gangsters from both countries, a fugitive Albanian <a href=#>drug</a> lord who flooded the UK with cocaine was last month arrested in the Turkish city of Istanbul.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tortured in toilet</h2><p>Dritan Rexhepi, in his early 40s, was once featured on Scotland Yard’s Most Wanted list because of his links to England.</p><p>He was arrested by armed police last month after an Interpol notice was issued by the <a href=#>Italian</a> and Albanian judicial authorities for alleged “wilful murder, drugs, kidnapping/deprivation of liberty, forgery of travel documents, weapons and ammunition”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kn_vlcsnap_2023-12-14-17h26m38s693jpg-JS866297997.jpg><p>Rexhepi is said to have been the leader of an international drug cartel called Kompanio Bello, which transports drugs from <a href=#>South America</a> to Europe.</p><p>In August, Britain announced a deal with Turkey aimed at disrupting smuggling gangs organising small boat Channel crossings.</p><p>The nations said they would step up “joint operations” in an attempt to block supplies of boat parts and other materials used by UK-bound asylum seekers.</p><p>In the meantime, experts claim drug gang violence is getting worse.</p><p>Four thugs were this week sentenced to a total of 48 years for kidnapping, torturing and killing Turkish radio DJ Mehmet Koray Alpergin.</p><p>The victim and his girlfriend Gozde Dalbudak, 34, were taken to an empty wine bar near <a href=#>Spurs</a> stadium, where she was forced to listen to her boyfriend being tortured while locked in a toilet.</p><p>The 43-year-old, who was said to have been heavily in debt, was beaten with a baseball bat, had boiling water poured on him and the soles of his feet were repeatedly stabbed.</p><p>Mehmet, the owner of <a href=#>London</a> station Bizim FM, was also sexually tortured before his body was dumped in Loughton, <a href=#>Essex</a>, where it was discovered by a dog walker in October 2022.</p><p>Prosecutor Crispin Aylett KC told the Old Bailey that the killing had “all the hallmarks of being linked to serious, organised crime — almost certainly drugs”.</p><p>Former undercover cop Neil Woods said drug gangs are becoming increasingly violent as Britain is flooded with cheap cocaine.</p><p>He explained: “One of the changes that Albanians have brought about is to cut out the middle men and deal directly with Latin-American (cartels).</p><p>“This has made the transnational supply routes much more efficient.</p><p>“They’ve become so efficient that there’s been a dramatic increase in the supply of cocaine.</p><p>“There is so much cocaine around that hundreds of kilos have been seized, but it’s made no difference to the supply or the cost.</p><p>“Police arrests constantly cause gaps in the drug market, which brings about instability and opportunities which are fought over — and the most ruthless and violent gangs tend to win.”</p><p>He added: “What also drives the war is informants. There is always someone ready to grass up a gang and organised crime knows this.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“The best way to make sure you’re not the one who is grassed up is to be the most ruthless, violent, feared person out there.</p><p>“Three years ago in the <a href=#>Netherlands</a> police found torture chambers as part of a huge investigation. The violence is stepping up all the time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/COURTS-Tottenham-15474551jpg-JS846450976.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/msemail_cnl_gozde_dalbudakjpg-JS846461141.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hellbanianz_8JPG-JS448561224-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/trp_gas_2jpg-JS788218178.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4Jxg5BrbXBnpKq%2FrLXSoWSapJKWu6qtzWabq62XYrSiusasZK2doqe8s7XSoqWgZZyku6W7zWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fturkish-albanian-drug-gangs-terrorising-london.html&text=Turkish%20%26amp%3b%20Albanian%20gangs%20have%20joined%20forces%20to%20terrorise%20London%20-%20as%20they%20mock%20%27weak%27%20UK%20and%20flaunt%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fturkish-albanian-drug-gangs-terrorising-london.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fturkish-albanian-drug-gangs-terrorising-london.html&title=Turkish%20%26amp%3b%20Albanian%20gangs%20have%20joined%20forces%20to%20terrorise%20London%20-%20as%20they%20mock%20%27weak%27%20UK%20and%20flaunt%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fturkish-albanian-drug-gangs-terrorising-london.html&title=Turkish%20%26amp%3b%20Albanian%20gangs%20have%20joined%20forces%20to%20terrorise%20London%20-%20as%20they%20mock%20%27weak%27%20UK%20and%20flaunt%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fturkish-albanian-drug-gangs-terrorising-london.html&title=Turkish%20%26amp%3b%20Albanian%20gangs%20have%20joined%20forces%20to%20terrorise%20London%20-%20as%20they%20mock%20%27weak%27%20UK%20and%20flaunt%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fturkish-albanian-drug-gangs-terrorising-london.html&description=Turkish%20%26amp%3b%20Albanian%20gangs%20have%20joined%20forces%20to%20terrorise%20London%20-%20as%20they%20mock%20%27weak%27%20UK%20and%20flaunt%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./verivery-has-revealed-the-final-dates-and-locations-for-their-us-tour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Verivery Has Revealed The Final Dates And Locations For Their US Tour">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./samantha-ruth-prabhu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Samantha Ruth Prabhu Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
