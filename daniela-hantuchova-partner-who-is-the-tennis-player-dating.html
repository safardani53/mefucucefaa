The former Slovak tennis player has been previously linked with other athletes.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hantuchova began her professional career in 1999 and won her first WTA Tour title in 2002 at the Indian Wells Masters. At one point in her tennis career, Daniela was the fifth-best player in the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/daniela-hantuchova-tennis-career.jpg><p>She completed the Career Grand Slam in mixed doubles, in 2005, winning the French Open and the US Open with Mahesh Bhupati. She previously won the Wimbledon in 2001 with Leos Friedl and the Australian Open with Kevin Ullyett in 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>Daniela announced her retirement from the sport in 2017 and began her career as a tennis commentator for Fox Sports. The Slovak tennis player has always been quiet about her dating life but was previously linked with the hockey legend <a href=# rel=noopener>Jaromír Jágr</a>.</p><h2>Daniela Hantuchova Partner: Who Is The Tennis Player Dating?</h2><p>The former Slovak tennis player, Daniel Hantuchova, doesn’t have a partner and appears single. But even previously, the commentator has never given too many details about her romantic relationships.</p><p>Hantuchova was previously linked with the hockey player Jaromír Jágr. The Czech hockey player previously played for several NHL teams, including the Penguins, the Capitals, the Rangers, the Flyers, and many others.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/daniela-hantuchova-boyfriend.jpg><p>Having played 36 professional seasons and over 2000 games, Jagr has had the longest playing career in professional ice hockey. He also has the second-most points in NHL history.</p><p>The hockey player was linked with the former tennis player for the first time in 2017. In 2019, the two athletes were again linked, with a few Czech sites reporting that the two met at a Christmas party and later went to one of his houses.</p><p>The two never confirmed their relationship. Since 2020, the hockey legend has been in a relationship with the Czech model Dominika Branisova.</p><p>The two have an age gap of 22 years, but their relationship seems to be heading the right way, with Dominika and the hockey player appearing in adverts together in recent years.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, Daniela was linked with the Dutch soccer player Wesley Sneijder and Australian golfer Adam Scott. The former tennis player also shares a special bond with the Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia.</p><p>In 2012, the two’s friendship was highlighted by the British tabloid <a href=# rel=noopener>The Telegraph</a>. Garcia and Hantuchova made a pact that the two would keep their heads up no matter what happened in their respective tournament.</p><p>Sergio is married to Angela Akins, and the couple shares two kids. The two got engaged in 2017 and tied the knot in the same year in Texas.</p><h2>Daniela Hantuchova Family</h2><p>Daniela was born in Poprad, Slovakia to Igor Hantuch, and Marianna Hantuchova. She also has an older brother named Igor Hantcuh Jr.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, on X (formerly Twitter), Daniela has shared a few snaps of her with her mom and older brother. Hantuchova was introduced to tennis by her grandmother, Helena, a former Slovak National Champion.</p><p>Daniela’s parents were athletes by trade. Her dad was a computer scientist, and her mother was a toxicologist. Her parents divorced in 2003, and this affected her performance.&nbsp;</p><p>It was only in 2004 that the tennis player revealed her parents’ divorce. During this time, Daniela faced many accusations of being anorexic and that she only cared about looking good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/daniela-hantuchova-family.jpg><p>But all that time, she was stressing about her parent’s divorce. She said, “I didn’t want to put my family into an area where they were being talked about.&nbsp;I wouldn’t be that stupid to talk about that to the press so they would be ridiculed.”</p><p>Daniela’s brother, Igor Hantuch Jr, resides in Monte Carlo, Monaco, and is a partner at EU Focus. He is also the managing director at Growth Tech Ventures and the Advisory Board Member of Climate Change Ventures.&nbsp;</p><p>Igor is also the founder and CEO of multiple companies, including h2way.org and TEG Development LLC. Unlike, Daniela isn’t very active on social media.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCwwKegnqSRYrWiutOumqGnppZ6sa3RraWeql2stbB5yKxkraCVYsGmus2iqmaonJbGpr6MnZitoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdaniela-hantuchova-partner-who-is-the-tennis-player-dating.html&text=Daniela%20Hantuchova%20Partner%3a%20Who%20Is%20The%20Tennis%20Player%20Dating%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdaniela-hantuchova-partner-who-is-the-tennis-player-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdaniela-hantuchova-partner-who-is-the-tennis-player-dating.html&title=Daniela%20Hantuchova%20Partner%3a%20Who%20Is%20The%20Tennis%20Player%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdaniela-hantuchova-partner-who-is-the-tennis-player-dating.html&title=Daniela%20Hantuchova%20Partner%3a%20Who%20Is%20The%20Tennis%20Player%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdaniela-hantuchova-partner-who-is-the-tennis-player-dating.html&title=Daniela%20Hantuchova%20Partner%3a%20Who%20Is%20The%20Tennis%20Player%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdaniela-hantuchova-partner-who-is-the-tennis-player-dating.html&description=Daniela%20Hantuchova%20Partner%3a%20Who%20Is%20The%20Tennis%20Player%20Dating%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joe-lombardi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Joe Lombardi net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./penis-plant-cambodia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cambodian Government Issues Warning After Women Play With Endangered &amp;quot;Penis Plant&amp;quot;">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
