Moreover, the NWHL star shares a very close bond with her siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>Her brothers and parents are the hockey player’s biggest support system. Even though she was the only girl in the rink most of the time, her family never used that fact as an issue to discourage her.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, the athlete did not let it bother her either and even competed in boys’ hockey. Besides that, she loved ice hockey ever since she was very young.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Brianna-Decker-Family-1024x1024.jpg><p>Little did she know, it would become an integral part of her life, and she would represent her country internationally in ice hockey and even win some gold medals.</p><p>Astonishingly, Decker started her ice hockey journey with Waukesha Youth Hockey Association when she was <strong>less than eight years old</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>When Decker was eight years old, she continued her hockey journey with the Madison Capitols Girls team and played there till she was 14 years old. Not to mention, Brianna played with the Wisconsin AAA Boy’s team during that time.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>You might like to read about: two-time Olympic Gold Medalist swimmer Lilly King.

At Shattuck, Decker worked hard on sharpening her skills and improving her games.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, in no time, the gold medalist became an exceptional player and even joined the school team in winning three National High School Championships. She won the championships in her freshman, sophomore, and senior year.&nbsp;</p><p>Following her high school graduation, the hockey player committed to the University of Wisconsin. She was an outstanding addition to the Wisconsin Badgers women’s ice hockey team.&nbsp;</p><p>The three-time Olympian won many awards and championships with the Badgers. Finally, she graduated from college with a degree in Human Development and Family Studies.&nbsp;</p><h2>Brianna Decker | Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>The gold-medalist athlete was born on May 13, 1991. Hence, she is <span>32 years old as of December, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Being an athlete, she takes great care of her diet and works out on a daily basis. As a result, the hockey player is in great shape and has a toned physique.</p><p>Furthermore, she is 5 ft 4 in (163 cm) tall and weighs 148 lb (67 kg).&nbsp;</p><h2>Brianna Decker | Ice Hockey Career</h2><h3>High School and College Career</h3><p>Brianna had always been an exceptional player from her early days. Therefore, during her time at St. Mary’s Prep High School, she won three National High School Championships.</p><p>Not to mention, her performance was outstanding in each of the tournaments. Following her successful high school career, she joined the University of Wisconsin.</p><p>As a result, she was now eligible to play in the NCAA with the Wisconsin Badgers women’s ice hockey team. Further, Decker instantly became the team’s offensive asset.</p><p>Eventually, she became the team’s third-highest score that season. In addition, she had missed more than half of the first part of the season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Brianna-Decker-College--1024x518.jpeg><p>Moreover, the ice hockey player intensified her play through each season. By the time the NWHL star was a junior, she held the longest scoring of 77 points streak at 32 games.</p><p>This performance helped her catch the eye of the national team’s scout. Further, her IIHF Worlds Women’s U18 performance had already secured her a spot on the national team.</p><p>Hence, with such an amazing performance, she won the <strong>Patty Kazmaier Award</strong> in her junior season.</p><h3>National and International Career</h3><h4>IIHF Women’s World Championship</h4><p>Decker’s national career began during her freshman year at the University of Wisconsin. She was a part of the USA’s U18 national women’s ice hockey team.</p><p>In her first year, she won gold at the 2009 IIHF World Women’s U18 Championship. Following her performance, she received a spot on US Women’s National Team’s preliminary roster.</p><p>However, the spot may not have been such a huge deal, but it certainly secured her the final cut on the US Women’s National Team’s roster in the near future.</p><p>Hence, in just 2 years, she made the final roster of the national team. Likewise, Decker was set to participate in the 2011 IIHF Women’s World Championship.</p><p>Furthermore, she became the top five scores of the tournament with 11 points. Her performance helped secure the gold medal for the team.</p><p>Similarly, Brianna has won additional four more gold medals in 2013, 2015 to, 2017, and 2019. Aside from that, she has two silver medals in 2012 and 2021.</p><h4>Olympics</h4><p>Being an elite forward, Decker got selected to represent Team USA in the winter Olympics three times. Her first Olympics game came at the 2014 Sochi winter Olympics.</p><p>This was a very controversial Olympics as Russia was blamed to have been targeting many LGBTQ+ athletes in the game.</p><p>Due to the fear of the Russians, many LGBTQ+ athletes didn’t participate. Decker was one of many straight athletes to have been protesting agents the biasness.</p><p>However, her protest didn’t stop her from competing in the Olympics. Further, she gave her heart and soul during the tournament.</p><p>It was almost clear that they would have won the tournament. However, the USA’s team gold medal dream was cut short by the elite Canadian team.</p><p>As a result, in Brianna’s first Olympic game, she received a silver medal. Nonetheless, in the next 2018 Olympics, the USA team came back against Canada’s team in the finals.</p><p>Therefore, Decker in her second Olympics game received a gold medal. Further, the USA named her an Olympian for the third time in the recent 2022 winter Olympics.</p><p>She couldn’t participate in all games as she received a lower-body injury in the game against Finland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Brianna-Decker-Injury-1024x683.webp><p>Following their successful victory in 2018, they failed to defend their title against Canada.
