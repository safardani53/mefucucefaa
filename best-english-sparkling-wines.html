Almost 70% of that was British bubbly, with English sparkling now served everywhere from <a href=#>King Charles</a>’ first State Banquet to British Airways flights.&nbsp;</p><p>Wineries are stepping up to meet demand too, offering vineyard tours, tasting sessions and even rooms to stay the night. However, you don’t have to visit the vineyard to get your hands on a bottle.</p><p>All major supermarkets and wine retailers now stock English sparkling wines and some have even teamed up with respected winemakers to produce their own bottles, which are often the most affordable way to sample homegrown bubbly.&nbsp;</p><p>To help you choose your favourite, we’ve sampled a range of the best English sparkling wines available in 2023, sniffing, swirling and sampling every one to find the standout sparkler.</p><h2>Best English sparkling wines at a glance:</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Gifts and Lifestyle</h2></p><h2>Ridgeview Bloomsbury NV</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ridgeview-Bloomsbury-NV-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Ridgeview Bloomsbury NV, £34.99 from Waitrose Cellar - <a href=# aria-label="buy here (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Stylish bottle from award-winning winemakers, produced by family-owned winery<br><strong>Cons: </strong>As expensive as champagne<br><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5&nbsp;</p><p>You’d be hard-pushed to tell this apart from even the finest champagne.</p><p>An established name in the English wine world, Ridgeview has been making English sparkling wine in Sussex since 1995 and has been at the forefront of pushing homegrown fizz into the global limelight.</p><p>The winery is now run by the second generation of the Roberts family and focuses solely on sparkling wine.

Based in Kent, it is the country’s largest producer and was making premium sparkling wine when most people still scoffed at homegrown bubbly.</p><p>Its North Downs vineyards have almost identical terroir to Champagne, with south-facing chalky soils and a warm, seaside climate, so its fizz is equally top-notch, served everywhere from Ascot to the Royal Opera House.&nbsp;</p><p>This one is its best-selling and is a pure joy to drink. Made with hand-pressed grapes, it’s a classic blend of big-name grapes and a sheer fruity triumph, with notes of red apple, citrus and still-warm bread.</p><p>Savour it in the garden on a sunny afternoon with a huge bowl of strawberries and cream and nothing will ever taste better.</p><p><strong>ABV: </strong>12%, <strong>Bottle size: </strong>75cl, <strong>Place of origin: </strong>Kent, <strong>Grape variety: </strong>Chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot meunier, pinot blanc</p><h2>Selborne Blanc de Blancs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Selborne-Blanc-de-Blancs-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Selborne Blanc de Blancs, £33.99 from Majestic - <a href=# aria-label="buy here (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Great example of blanc de blancs, perfect for those who prefer a fresher taste<br><strong>Cons: </strong>More expensive than some other sparkling wines<br><strong>Rating: </strong>4.5/5</p><p>Not all sparkling wines are created equally. This one is a blanc de blancs — translated as ‘white of whites’ — which means the fizz is only made from white grapes, ideal for anyone looking for a lighter, dryer drop.</p><p>Be warned, though — blanc de blancs tend to be a little pricier than brut sparkling wine.&nbsp;</p><p>Refreshing but delicate, this one has a lively mousse and a rush of citrus flavours that give way to rich brioche notes.</p><p>Its crisp acidity means it cuts nicely through rich or fattier foods, so we’d enjoy it with traditional fish and chips for the ultimate English feast.</p><p><strong>ABV: </strong>12%, <strong>Bottle size: </strong>75cl,<strong> Place of origin: </strong>Hampshire,<strong> Grape variety: </strong>Chardonnay</p><h2>Denbies Whitedowns Sparkling NV</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Denbies-Whitedowns-Sparkling-NV-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Denbies Whitedowns Sparkling NV, £18.99 from Waitrose Cellar - <a href=# aria-label="buy here (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Good chance to try little-known grapes, spends two years maturing on lees, good price<br><strong>Cons: </strong>Stronger tasting and smelling than traditional English sparkling<br><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>While champagne has to abide by a strict set of rules to be labelled as such, winemakers in England are allowed to be a little more adventurous.</p><p>This intriguing fizz is made by Denbies, one of England’s largest single-estate vineyards with a production capacity of one million bottles. Spread over 265 acres in the Surrey Hills, the sprawling estate includes its own hotel and restaurant. It even hosts its own half marathon with wine stops along the way!&nbsp;</p><p>It's no surprise this bubbly is far from ordinary, then. Unusually, it’s made from traditional – and rarely used – grape varieties like seyval and reichensteiner. Pinot noir gives it structure and the wine has crisp lemon and apple flavours on the palate with a creamy finish and fine acidity.</p><p>Open a bottle with hunk of brie and you’ll think you’ve died and gone to food pairing heaven.</p><p><strong>ABV: </strong>12%,<strong> Bottle size: </strong>75cl,<strong> Place of origin: </strong>Surrey,<strong> Grape variety: </strong>Reichensteiner, seyval blanc, pinot noir</p><h2>Adnams English Sparkling Classic Cuvee</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Adnams-English-Sparkling-Classic-Cuvee-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>English Sparkling Classic Cuvee, £24.99 from Adnams - <a aria-label="buy here (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Vintage wine guaranteeing quality grapes from a specified year, excellent price for a vintage bubbly<br><strong>Cons: </strong>The cork comes without a traditional capsule (the foil around the wire cage) making the bottle look less appealing than others<br><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>Unlike most of the English sparkling wines we tested, this bottle is vintage so all the grapes are top quality and come from a specific year – in this case, 2017.</p><p>Usually more expensive than non-vintage bubbly, this is a steal at £25 if you’re determined to sample a vintage vino.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s made by Devon’s Lyme Bay winery, which hand-picks and whole-cluster-presses the grapes so only the very best make it into the wine.</p><p>Like champers, it’s made in the traditional method and matured on lees for at least two years to develop its vibrant, deep flavours. Expect a rush of grass and green apples, followed by delicate florals, zingy lemon and a distinctive hint of toast.</p><p>If this doesn’t make you fall for English fizz, nothing will.</p><p><strong>ABV: </strong>12.5%,<strong> Bottle size: </strong>75cl,<strong> Place of origin: </strong>Devon, <strong>Grape variety: </strong>Chardonnay, pinot noir</p><h2>Bramble Hill Sparkling Wine of England</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bramble-Hill-Sparkling-Wine-of-England-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Bramble Hill Sparkling Wine of England (Case of 6), £84 from M&S - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Excellent price per bottle, goes well with food, also available as a rosé, suitable for vegans<br><strong>Cons: </strong>Can only be bought in cases of six online (though individual bottles are available in-store), not produced using the traditional method<br><strong>Rating: </strong>3.5/5</p><p>Made on Kent’s Silverhand Estate, this budget bubbly from M&S is half the price of most bottles of champagne, yet is the ideal floral fizz for celebrating.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike most English sparkling wines (and all champagnes), it’s produced like prosecco using the more cost-effective Charmat method which means its bubbles are produced in large tanks rather than inside individual bottles.</p><p>There’s even a touch of the little-used Bacchus grape alongside the usual big three to give it a fruitier, tangier taste than the toasty biscuit flavour you would expect from champagne.</p><p>Notes of gooseberry and apple make it deliciously drinkable with a colourful salad or even chicken straight from the barbecue. And at this price, you can even treat yourself to a second bottle.</p><p><strong>ABV: </strong>12.5%, <strong>Bottle size: </strong>75cl, <strong>Place of origin: </strong>Kent, <strong>Grape variety: </strong>Chardonnay, pinot noir, meunier, bacchus&nbsp;</p><h2>Louis Pommery England Brut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Louis-Pommery-England-Brut-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Louis Pommery England Brut, £26 £25 from Sainsbury's - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Made with the expertise of a French champagne house, ideal for dedicated champagne fans<br><strong>Cons: </strong>Some might prefer to choose an English producer<br><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>It’s proof of how popular English sparkling has become that even the major champagne houses are keen to get a part of the action.</p><p>Pommery is the first to stake its claim and has been planting vines on the rolling Hampshire Hills since 2017, one of the eight <a aria-label="Vineyards of Hampshire (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">Vineyards of Hampshire</a> that offers wine tours and combined tasting experiences.</p><p>The first wine from those grapes won’t be ready until late 2024, so Louis Pommery has bought in fruit from other local vineyards for this bubbly in the meantime.</p><p>It has all the finesse and delicacy you’d expect from this prestigious producer and is of course made using the traditional method. Pale yellow in the glass, it brims with fruit aromas including peach and lemon that follow through on the palate for an all-round fantastic fizz.</p><p><strong>ABV: </strong>12.5%, <strong>Bottle size: </strong>75cl,<strong> Place of origin: </strong>Hampshire, <strong>Grape variety: </strong>Chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot meunier</p><h2>Tesco Finest English Sparkling Rosé Brut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tesco-Finest-English-Sparkling-Rose-Brut-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Finest English Sparkling Rosé Brut, £20 from Tesco - <a href=# aria-label="buy here (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Produced by an award-winning winery, suitable for vegans, excellent value, can be paired with heartier foods, easy to pick up during the weekly shop<br><strong>Cons: </strong>Often sells out online, too fruity for those who prefer white sparkling<br><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>English sparkling doesn’t have to be white. Most wineries now also produce pale pink rosé versions, perfect for a summer’s afternoon.</p><p>This one is made by Balfour, one of England’s best-known wineries, which produces over 400,000 bottles each year. Its 400-acre Hush Heath estate was once a working farm but is now leading the way in English wine tourism, with expert-led vineyard tours, a restaurant and even live music evenings.&nbsp;</p><p>Its rosé sparkling for Tesco is astonishingly good value, made in the traditional method with hand-harvested grapes. A beautiful pale pink, it pops with bright strawberry and lemon flavours with a fresh acidity that allows it to hold its own against all kinds of food.</p><p>We’d serve it alongside a traditional afternoon tea for a five-star treat.</p><p><strong>ABV: </strong>12%, <strong>Bottle size: </strong>75cl,<strong> Place of origin: </strong>Kent,<strong> Grape variety: </strong>Chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot meunier&nbsp;</p><h2>Silverhand Estate Silver Reign Brut NV</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Silverhand-Estate-Silver-Reign-Brut-NV-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Silverhand Estate Silver Reign Brut NV, £21.50 from Noble Green Wines - <a href=# aria-label="buy here (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Reasonably priced, softer and fruitier than other sparkling wines making it easy to drink, ideal for those who prefer a slightly sweeter fizz<br><strong>Cons: </strong>May not be dry enough for those looking for a traditional champagne taste<br><strong>Rating: </strong>3.5/5</p><p>Closer in taste to prosecco than champagne, this is another bottle produced using the Charmat method, making it the bottle to buy for anyone who finds other bubbly too dry.</p><p>It’s just as chockful of flavour as any other Brit fizz though, and even recently won the silver medal at the WineGB Awards 2023.</p><p>Produced by the new Silverhand Estate, it tastes like the English countryside in a glass, with notes of green apples, elderflower, freshly picked pears and hedgerow flowers with an added twist of lemon.</p><p>Easy drinking and refreshing, it would pep up even the most average picnic.</p><h2>Bolney Wine Estate South Downs Vintage Release 2013</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bolney-Wine-Estate-South-Downs-Vintage-Release-2013-rotated.jpg><ul><li><strong>Bolney Wine Estate South Downs Vintage Release 2013, £32 from Tesco - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Produced by award-winning winery, 2013 is considered an excellent year for sparkling wine, lower alcohol than other bottles<br><strong>Cons: </strong>Vintage means it’s more expensive&nbsp;<br><strong>Rating: </strong>4.5/5&nbsp;</p><p>Keen to avoid a sore head in the morning?

Shop here for the best selection:&nbsp;</p><h2>Is English sparkling wine as good as Champagne?&nbsp;</h2><p>While champagne’s worldwide prestige is hard to rival, the best English sparkling wine is more than a match for its French equivalent in the glass. In fact, in a recent blind taste test by Kent’s Chapel Down on the streets of Reims, <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">60% of the French drinkers polled preferred the English sparkling to their native champagne.</a></p><p>The wine world agrees. Expert judges at this year’s Global Sparkling Masters 2023 gave the top award to a bottle from Devon’s Sandridge Barton, beating the most prestigious champagnes.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is the best English sparkling wine?</h2><p>Like all wine, the best English sparkling wine is a matter of personal taste. Sample a few and find the one that appeals the most.</p><p>If you prefer one that is fruitier and not quite as bone-dry, look for one produced using the Charmat method, while blanc de blancs from only white grapes will deliver a fresher, lighter wine.</p><p>For a fizz to eat with food, it’s worth trying a versatile rosé which will pair perfectly with everything from light fruit desserts to a Chinese takeaway.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2>How much does English sparkling wine cost?</h2><p>Don’t expect prosecco prices. English sparkling wine is generally produced using the more expensive traditional method so you won’t find bottles under £5.</p><p>Anything under £20 is a steal, especially if it’s a vintage or a blanc de blancs. Generally, excellent English sparkling wine costs between £20 and £35, though the very best examples will set you back even more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Want to find more savings on your online shopping?
