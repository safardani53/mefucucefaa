Accordingly, he was traded to Oakland Raiders in March 2019. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jon Gruden</strong></a> was the coach there.

In the video, he said he had just proposed to Chelsie Kyriss.</p><p>Accordingly, he was hugging her. Although the woman’s face was not seen, she looked pretty like her.</p><p>However, she is yet to flaunt her engagement ring on her social media platforms.
