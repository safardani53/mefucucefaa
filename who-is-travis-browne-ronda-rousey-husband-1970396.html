In June 20, 2015, Travis was ranked number 5 in official UFC Heavyweight rankings. The then-238 lb. fighter has been competing since 2009 and his current mixed martial arts record is 18 wins and 7 losses. His last win came in January 2016 against&nbsp;<strong>Matt Mitrione</strong>. Travis has not had a match since July 2017.</p><h2>Ronda and Travis Married In 2017</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Travis-Browne-5-things-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Travis and Ronda started dating sometime in 2015. After roughly two years of dating they got engaged in April 2017. Just a few short months later, the two got married in August 2017 in Hawaii. Before their nuptials, Ronda got very candid about her lack of wedding planning. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what goes into planning a wedding,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt could be really easy because I don‚Äôt really want a lot. We don‚Äôt really need decorations or flowers; just somewhere to go, something to eat, and some people around.‚Äù</p><h2>Ronda and Travis share one daughter together</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>In an Instagram announcement Ronda shared on September 27, 2021, it was revealed she and Travis became <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>parents to their first child</a> together!&nbsp; She did not reveal her daughter‚Äôs face, but showed off her tiny hand as she snuggled close to her mom‚Äôs chest. In the picture‚Äôs caption, Ronda also debuted her and Travis‚Äôs baby girl‚Äôs name: <strong>La‚Äôakea Makalapuaokalanip≈ç Browne</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>La‚Äôakea‚Äôs birth came five months after Ronda <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced her pregnancy</a>. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm four months pregnant? What? You didn‚Äôt even know the last four months!‚Äù she said in a YouTube video on April 21. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôve been pregnant since January, so four months. Woo! Baby bump! I can‚Äôt hide it anymore, so it‚Äôs time to show it off.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In addition to La‚Äôakea, Travis is the father of two sons from his first marriage. Their names are <strong>Kaleo</strong> and <strong>Keawe </strong>and although their ages haven‚Äôt been confirmed, they appear to be in their teenage years based <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>off of a photo</a> shared to Ronda‚Äôs Instagram page in 2020.</p><h2>Travis Has Been Married Before</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Travis has been married twice before. His first marriage was to <strong>Erin Browne</strong>, with whom he shares his two sons, from 2001-2009. From 2015-2016, he was married to fitness model <strong>Jenna Renee Webb</strong>, and was technically still married to her when he started dating Ronda. Travis and his then-estranged wife were completely separated and were in the process of filing for divorce when he was dating Ronda.</p><h2>Travis Was Accused Of Domestic Violence In 2015</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Travis‚Äô ex-wife, Jenna, claimed that the reason the pair split was because Travis assaulted her physically as well as abused her mentally and emotionally. Jenna even posted photos of massive bruises on her body via Instagram. Ronda even addressed the allegations in 2015. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs really hard. I‚Äôm very anti-domestic violence,‚Äù Ronda revealed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ESPN</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>‚ÄúBut I know that he didn‚Äôt do anything. Now I‚Äôm put in a situation where I‚Äôm finally happy with somebody that respects me and cares about me, and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòWhat do I do?‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Why can‚Äôt [people] have some confidence or trust in me that I would make a good decision and be with a good man regardless of how it looks.‚Äù Travis was suspended by the UFC but was reinstated when their independent investigation found ‚Äúinconclusive evidence‚Äù of any assault.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Travis often shares photos of different animals, including dogs and chickens, to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> and adds loving captions about the importance of them. He often updates his followers about the animals and how they help out on the ranch he runs. He also shares several photos and videos of him and his family happily riding horses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LBs63VoqpmmqKkxK%2BxjKump5yRYr%2BwwdKesGagpaivorrDZmhyb2Bohnd7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-travis-browne-ronda-rousey-husband-1970396.html&text=Who%20Is%20Travis%20Browne%3f%205%20Things%20About%20Ronda%20Rouseys%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-travis-browne-ronda-rousey-husband-1970396.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-travis-browne-ronda-rousey-husband-1970396.html&title=Who%20Is%20Travis%20Browne%3f%205%20Things%20About%20Ronda%20Rouseys%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-travis-browne-ronda-rousey-husband-1970396.html&title=Who%20Is%20Travis%20Browne%3f%205%20Things%20About%20Ronda%20Rouseys%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-travis-browne-ronda-rousey-husband-1970396.html&title=Who%20Is%20Travis%20Browne%3f%205%20Things%20About%20Ronda%20Rouseys%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-travis-browne-ronda-rousey-husband-1970396.html&description=Who%20Is%20Travis%20Browne%3f%205%20Things%20About%20Ronda%20Rouseys%20Husband%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-is-andrew-garfield-taking-a-break-from-acting.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Is Andrew Garfield Taking A Break From Acting?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./melodee-morita-19910725-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Melodee Morita (Director) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
