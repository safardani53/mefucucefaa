Another cut, U know what babes I’ve had enough. Cut me with a Stanley blade.”</p><p>The duo were supposed to be performing at <a href=#>Brighton</a> Pride that same month but had to pull out after erratic Spedding stabbed <a href=#>Sophie</a> again then stabbed himself, text messages showed.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>On August 6 she sent a message to a friend, which read: “I know I think he will kill me.”</p><p>Sending a photo to another friend, showing scars all over her face, she wrote: “I don’t know who I am anymore. Look at these scars on my face.&nbsp; I’ll never get rid of these. He’s so manipulative.</p><p>“All I’ve ever been is good. I’ve spent all my money on him.</p><p>"I can’t take anymore”.</p><p>One friend said: “There was a whole group of us who were doing everything we could to get Sophie out of this situation and to safety.</p><p>I can't take any more."</p><span class=quote-credit>Sophie Anderson</span><p>“But Oliver was extremely manipulative, he would take Sophie’s phones from her so she couldn’t communicate with any one.</p><p>“Sometimes he would take her phone and text us and pretend it was her, so we never knew who we were talking to.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>CHAOTIC LIFESTYLE</h2><p>“He made her leave her home and live in a campervan and travel from hotel to hotel all over the country doing appearances and meeting clients, so if any reports were made to police, it was in different jurisdictions and hard to find them as they were of no fixed address.</p><p>"He knew fine well what he was doing and this allowed him to carry on his abuse for longer.</p><p>“He would make her do bookings even when she wasn’t physically well enough to and he would insert his way into them.</p><p>“The campervan was urine-soaked and disgusting. Oliver was a big drinker and would drink bottles of Jack Daniels and take GHB.</p><p>"He plied Sophie was drugs even though Sophie had well known issues with drugs in the past.</p><p>“He took all her money and bank cards. He tried to ruin her businesses by posting transphobic content when Sophie was a huge supporter of trans rights and had many trans followers. He was jealous of her success because everybody loved her.</p><p>“She was scared but she felt she had no escape, that no one would listen to her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'HE BROKE HER'</h2><p>“He called her ugly and made her feel bad about herself. He broke her down in every way possible.</p><p>“But through it all, she was always her lovely bubbly self and cared for everyone, she was always checking on other people over herself.</p><p>“The last time one of us saw her she was skeletal, dishevelled, just emotionally broken. Her death has broken all our hearts, we can't imagine life without her.”</p><p>Friends began contacting police about the abuse in September after his latest death hoax – and reports were made with three different <a href=#>police</a> forces the <a href=#>Met</a>, <a href=#>Sussex Police</a> and <a href=#>Thames Valley</a>.</p><p>Spedding was finally arrested on September 11, with Thames Valley Police stating: “At around 6.14pm on 11 September we received reports of an assault with injury on the M40 in High Wycombe.</p><p>“Officers arrested a 34-year-old man from London on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent, false imprisonment and sending offensive/indecent/obscene/menacing messages on 12 September. The case has now been filed with no further action.”</p><p>However Spedding was released that same day and despite the restrictions of his bail went back to Sophie and began posting online – in a now-deleted post – where he ranted about people lying about him and issued a chilling threat: “invade my space then u will be laid to rest.”</p><p>Worried friends then contacted police again – and on October 6, around 30 pieces of evidence including text messages and graphic photos of injuries were given to Thames Valley Police.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">HOW YOU CAN GET HELP:</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Women's Aid has this advice for victims and their families</p><ul><li>Always keep your phone nearby.</li><li>Get in touch with charities for help, including the Women’s Aid live chat helpline and services such as SupportLine.</li><li>If you are in danger, call 999.</li><li>Familiarise yourself with the Silent Solution, reporting abuse without speaking down the phone, instead dialing “55”.</li><li>Always keep some money on you, including change for a pay phone or bus fare.</li><li>If you suspect your partner is about to attack you, try to go to a lower-risk area of the house – for example, where there is a way out and access to a telephone.</li><li>Avoid the kitchen and garage, where there are likely to be knives or other weapons.
