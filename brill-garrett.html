Who Are Her Parents?</h2><p>Brill Garrett was born Brill Aldridge in Illinois to her parents, Jeffrey Aldridge and Judy Aldridge.</p><p>Mrs. Garrett grew up alongside her brother, Jeff Aldridge. But the whereabouts of her parents and brother are unknown at the moment.</p><p>As for her academics, Brill was a student at Central High School located in Hinsdale, Illinois.</p><p>After completing high school in 1984, she enrolled at Princeton University. Garrett also acquired a law degree from Harvard University.</p><h2>Age, Height & Ethnicity</h2><p>The gorgeous wife of Jason Garrett is a total beauty, and we can see why Jason would be attracted to her in the first place.</p><p>Brill was born in the year 1965, which makes her 57 years old as of 2023. She celebrates her birthday on December 8, and her zodiac sign is Sagittarius.</p><p>And people under this sign are known to be free-spirited, smart, and risk-takers.</p><p>Brill stands at 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters) and weighs around 60 kg (132 pounds).&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it’s her diet or some secret, but Garrett has maintained her body and has a toned physique. She has shoulder-length blonde hair and vivid blue eyes, which complements her appearance.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>As we know, Brill Garrett is a married woman and is the wife of a former American football player and coach, Jason Garrett.</p><p>The couple tied the knot sometime in 1994 when Jason was still active as a player and was with the Miami Dolphins.

They took time and slowly started dating and eventually fell madly in love with each other.</p><p>Jason and Brill probably dated for around ten years before Jason popped the question.&nbsp;</p><p>As of 2023, the happy duo has been married for almost 29 years.</p><p>At an award function in 2017, Jason thanked his wife and described her as a best friend who is also his biggest supporter and pillar.</p><p>This is not the first time Jason has acknowledged his wife for his achievements.
