According to court records acquired by TMZ, Mathew Rosengart stated in the docs that the group misled to the court about not being engaged in Spears’ conservatorship and receiving more than $18 million from her 13-year conservatorship. Scott Edelman, the entertainment company’s lawyer, responded to these claims:</p><p>“This is very deceptive. As the evidence clearly shows, the conservatorship was established on the advice of legal counsel, not Tri Star, and was sanctioned by the Court for more than 12 years. Tri Star was not even the conservatorship’s business manager when it was founded.”</p><p>Edelman went on to say that once the data are released, all of the claimed fraudulent accusations would be cleared up.</p><h2><span class="jss5259 jss5277"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~0~0 class="jss5261 jss5278">Britney&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss5259 jss5279"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~1~0 class="jss5261 jss5280">Spears’&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss5259 jss5281"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~2~0 class="jss5261 jss5282">father&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss5259 jss5283"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~3~0 class="jss5261 jss5284">took&nbsp;</span><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~3~1 class="jss5261 jss5285">money&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss5259 jss5286"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~4~0 class="jss5261 jss5287">from&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss5259 jss5288"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~5~0 class="jss5261 jss5289">Tri&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss5259 jss5290"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~6~0 class="jss5261 jss5291">Star&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss5259 jss5292"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~7~0 class="jss5261 jss5293">Entertainment.</span></span></h2><p>Rosengart also alleged in court filings that before Britney Spears’s father, Jamie Spears, who had been in charge of her conservatorship for 13 years, became her daughter’s temporary guardian, he had withdrawn $40,000 from Tri Star, which was not as large at the time as it is today.</p><p>Mathew Rosengart provided another explanation, claiming that Jamie may have made a deal with Tri Star in which he would collect the money as well as Britney’s entertainment firm.
