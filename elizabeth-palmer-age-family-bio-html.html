But, what remains known is that she was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">raised</a> in Canada after her family immigrated when she was of a young age.</p><h2>Palmer Graduated in Journalism</h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>The British-Canadian completed her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">graduation</a> with a bachelor of arts in English from the University of British Columbia with honors in 1976.

Together, they share&nbsp;two beautiful children, Zachary, 31, and Chloe, 22. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her husband Laporte is the pillar who has kept her family of four alive in her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">absence</a>, as she covered news from war zones staying away from home.</p><p><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>CBS Correspondent Bianna Golodryga's Utterly Supports Husband & Family Through Rough Times</a></strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Along with her husband, her kids have been very supportive of her work, too.

But despite feeding on green veggies and healthy meals, the once average weighted Elizabeth, who never had to care about weight loss, fell into the hole of junk food during her middle school days.</p><p></p><p><strong>Weight Loss: Elizabeth Palmer on the right in 2013 and on the left in 2018.&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: Pinterest)</p><p>The result of her unhealthy eating habits showed its outcome later in the years. Back in 2010, due to her increasing body weight, she suffered from slight depression as no matter how much she tried, her weight loss goals failed.&nbsp;</p><p>But now, comparing from her recent pictures to previous, Palmer has finally pursued the weight loss she aspired to achieve.&nbsp;</p><h2>CBS News Correspondent Since 2000 — How Much Salary Does Palmer Earn?</h2><p>Palmer’s professional career in broadcasting started as a special correspondent for the Canadian network in 1988. In the 1990s, she covered the crash of ruble and the Chechen War based in Latin America, Russia, and Central Asia.</p><p>From 1994 to 1997, she served as a senior correspondent for Latin American Bureau in Mexico City. After that, she joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as senior correspondent and bureau chief in Moscow from 1997 to 2000. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She embarked on the CBS Network in 2000 as a correspondent based in Moscow.
