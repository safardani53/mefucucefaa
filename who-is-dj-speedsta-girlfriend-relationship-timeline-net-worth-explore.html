Before relocating to Johannesburg to follow his dreams, he attended Vaalpark Articon High School in Gauteng’s Vaal Triangle.&nbsp;He was a well-behaved child, but his outspoken attitude caused friction with his parents since he refused to attend private schools and preferred public institutions, which he said matched his vibrant personality.</p><p>Speedy subsequently moved to Johannesburg and enrolled at Johannesburg University for a bachelor’s degree in business administration, but left out to pursue his DJ career.&nbsp;His career started after he won the 2008 edition of ‘So you think you can DJ.’ In 2011, he was Djing at a Drake event and had the audience going wild, so he decided to continue Djing professionally and explore music composition.</p><h2>DJ Speedsta’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>DJ Speedsta</strong> has a net worth of $5 million as of July 2023.

Little is known about his properties, however, he is supposed to possess a nice property in Johannesburg.</p><p>He also bought a huge apartment in the Vaal for his family. Furthermore, DJ Speedsta is only known to possess a BMW M3 and a Mini Cooper.&nbsp;He has also been reported commenting on the Porsche Panamera, the 2018 South African car of the year, but has yet to be seen driving the opulent machine.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBusMlmqqmdlZnAta2MoKCrpJantqa6w2apnqSRqbawutKhoKllpJ66prjIp5xmppWperi70a2fZp2opbmwvsRo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-dj-speedsta-girlfriend-relationship-timeline-net-worth-explore.html&text=Who%20Is%20DJ%20Speedsta%20Girlfriend%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Explore&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-dj-speedsta-girlfriend-relationship-timeline-net-worth-explore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-dj-speedsta-girlfriend-relationship-timeline-net-worth-explore.html&title=Who%20Is%20DJ%20Speedsta%20Girlfriend%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Explore" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-dj-speedsta-girlfriend-relationship-timeline-net-worth-explore.html&title=Who%20Is%20DJ%20Speedsta%20Girlfriend%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Explore" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-dj-speedsta-girlfriend-relationship-timeline-net-worth-explore.html&title=Who%20Is%20DJ%20Speedsta%20Girlfriend%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Explore" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-dj-speedsta-girlfriend-relationship-timeline-net-worth-explore.html&description=Who%20Is%20DJ%20Speedsta%20Girlfriend%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth%20Explore" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./american-pickers-mike-wolfe-leticia-tour-kentucky-home.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="American Pickers star Mike Wolfe's girlfriend Leticia Cline gives tour of newly-revamped Kentucky ho">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-comedy-jam.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Comedy Jam Season 1 Episodes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
