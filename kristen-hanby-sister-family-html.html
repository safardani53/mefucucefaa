His usual subjects for the prank videos are his family members, especially his mother.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Hence, in this article, we try to cover the most asked questions about his marital status, dating history, and family members, including his father, mother, brothers, sister, and cousins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Kristen Hanby married or dating?</h2><p>Kristen Hanby has been in a relationship with social media influencer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jasmine Brownsword</a> for a long time. She regularly appears in his music, prank videos, and vlogs. She has 277k followers on her Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Kristen is yet to make Jasmine his wife, but they still have a strong bond despite not taking their relationship to the next level.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Kristen Hanby and his girlfriend are awaiting a baby girl</h2><p>In July 2022, Kristen was super excited when he disclosed via video on his Instagram that he would be a dad soon. The caption wrote, "SO….. IM GOING TO BE A DAD!! Unexpected but very excited!!!," and he whispered in the video, "mini me."</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Later, in September, the pair revealed they were expecting a daughter in a gender reveal event.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Kristen had surprised his family when he shared his partner's pregnancy news with them for the first time in July. The news made all the family members upbeat and happy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where Is Kristen Hanby from?</h2><p>Hanby was born on March 8, 1993, in Jersey&nbsp;on the Channel Island between Great Britain and France. It has a population of around 100,000. He started his career&nbsp;by making videos on&nbsp;his native Island, Jersey. He is&nbsp;currently based in Los Angeles, California, in pursuit of making a name for himself in the entertainment business.&nbsp;</p><p>As of this writing, he has 3.2 million followers on his self-titled <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Youtube</a> channel, 7.3 million followers on his<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Instagram</a>, and 19 million followers on<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Facebook</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Although not verified by major publications, many platforms have estimated his net worth to be in the range of $1.5 to $6 million.&nbsp;</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Who are Kristen Hanby's Family Members?</h2><p>Talking about his family tree, Kristen was born to his mother, Giselle Hanby. However, as of now, the Hanby family has not disclosed Kristen's dad yet. Therefore, there is not much information about his dad. Hence, it is unknown whether his dad is still alive.&nbsp;</p><p>Hanby belongs to a family of six, including his mother, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Giselle Hanby</a>, two sisters, Natalie and Bryony Hanby, a brother Jonathan Hanby, and his long-lost father, who abandoned his family many years ago. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His grandmother is occasionally seen in his videos and family pictures, but whether she lives separately or with Hanby's family is unclear. &nbsp;</p><p>His family members are a regular fixture in his videos. Sometimes, his silly acts seem to outrage them. And due to his theatrics,&nbsp;the <a href=# rel=follow>prankster</a> is often seen getting slapped or shouted at by his participating family member. But it can be assumed that they maintain good faith among themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Kristen's popularity has made his sisters famous</h2><p>His elder sister Natalie, who goes by the Instagram handle <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@nathanby123</a>, currently has 673k followers on her social media. At the same time,&nbsp;his younger sister, Bryony or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bryonyjasmine3</a>, on Instagram is followed by 286k fans.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The most popular sister, Natalie, is married and mother to two kids, an elder daughter Lexi, and an August 2021-born&nbsp;younger daughter, Atlas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Promisingly, Natalie also got engaged to her longtime partner Ruben Fernandes in August 2022.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Kristen Hanby's height and weight?</h2><p>Hanby weighs 65 kilos (143&nbsp;pounds), and his height is 172 centimeters (5 feet and 8 inches).</p><h2>Did Kristen Hanby win?</h2><p>The&nbsp;exclusive boxing feud between Hanby and fellow Youtuber Vitaly that took place at the OVO arena in Londen in March 2022&nbsp;on the <a href=# rel="follow noopener">undercard of Deji vs. Alex Wassabi</a>&nbsp;ended in a draw. Vitaly had previously said he would finish the match within 60 seconds, but the fight continued until the 4th round. Vitaly was on the front foot majority of the time, whereas Hanby was agile and moved a lot to counterattack.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>None of the participants could land clear punches often. Hanby, especially, resorted to clinching&nbsp;and headbutting to avoid getting hit.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, Vitaly claimed that the judges "<a href=# rel="follow noopener">fixed</a>" the match by accepting his opponent's dirty game.&nbsp;</p><h2>How did it Start for Kristen Hanby?</h2><p>Once, during his early years, he posted a prank video of his family on his Facebook account. It went on to generate a lot of views and gave the newbie his first-hand fame.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he got his first actual break after his five-part&nbsp;prank video&nbsp;went viral, gathering over 100,000&nbsp;views. In this video, Hanby is playing pranks with his&nbsp;elder sister Natalie.</p><p>Before establishing himself as a popular <a href=# rel=follow>YouTuber</a>, Hanby had a career as a carpenter and was busy working at construction sites. He did the job&nbsp;for six years.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his first taste of viral fame made him rethink his ongoing profession and career. This made him start&nbsp;posting a lot of&nbsp;videos online, showcasing his version of humor. Currently, he is known as a guy who would do absolutely anything to bring humor to his videos.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Kristen Hanby is a popular singer</h2><p>Apart from making videos for fun. As a side project, Hanby makes music&nbsp;and has songs like 'Fast and Dangerous,' 'On the Road,' 'Good Girl,'&nbsp;and 'Change My Mind,' to name a few on his resume. He has been interested in making music and rapping since a young age.</p><p>In fact, his music and songs have been very popular and have accumulated millions of views on Youtube.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Hanby's endorsement of Manchester United's Jesse Lingard</h2><p>Hanby's popularity can be felt because he was approached to promote&nbsp;merchandise for&nbsp;Manchester United's forward Jesse Lingard. He was asked by Lingard's&nbsp;personal assistant to promote the forward's&nbsp;clothing launch in Manchester last year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Speaking&nbsp;to Squaremile</a>, Hanby revealed&nbsp;he is a huge supporter of the Premier League outfit and claims to have met dynamic forward <a href=# rel=follow>Marcus Rashford</a> during the merch launch. He also claims to be a regular attendee at Old Trafford.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKOinsC1sc1mn5qmkq56tLXSrZyrZZaWuqq42GefraWc</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkristen-hanby-sister-family-html.html&text=Kristen%20Hanby%20Family%20Tree%3a%20Family%20Members%20%26amp%3b%20Siblings%20Covered&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkristen-hanby-sister-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkristen-hanby-sister-family-html.html&title=Kristen%20Hanby%20Family%20Tree%3a%20Family%20Members%20%26amp%3b%20Siblings%20Covered" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkristen-hanby-sister-family-html.html&title=Kristen%20Hanby%20Family%20Tree%3a%20Family%20Members%20%26amp%3b%20Siblings%20Covered" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkristen-hanby-sister-family-html.html&title=Kristen%20Hanby%20Family%20Tree%3a%20Family%20Members%20%26amp%3b%20Siblings%20Covered" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkristen-hanby-sister-family-html.html&description=Kristen%20Hanby%20Family%20Tree%3a%20Family%20Members%20%26amp%3b%20Siblings%20Covered" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mafs-uk-ella-morgan-unrecognisable-facial-surgery-pictures.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="MAFS UK legend Ella Morgan looks unrecognisable before facial surgery as she shares bandaged and bru">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kim-alexis-19600715-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Alexis (Model) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
