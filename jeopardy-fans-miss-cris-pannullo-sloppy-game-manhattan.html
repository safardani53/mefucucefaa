Madonna, a music journalist from Massachusetts (with a fitting name given her profession) and Sriram Krishnan, a consultant from Virginia.</p><p>Going into Final Jeopardy, Sriram had $21,800, Ron $10,800 and A.Z. $8,000.</p><p>The category was "Name's the same" and host <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48 read: "A cocktail, an island & a WWII venture originally called 'Development of Substitute Materials' all bear this name."</p><p>All three contestants were incorrect and couldn't put together that the clue was looking for "Manhattan."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Jeopardy!">Read more on Jeopardy!</h2><p>A.Z. wrote: "Mai Tai?", Ron "Martini" and shrugged, and Sriram also wrote "Martini" with what looked two "i's" that looked like "colons," fans said.</p><p>The newcomer bet $0 so he stood pat and won with $21,800.</p><p>Last night, fans were miffed that <a href=#>Cris' victor Andy Tirrell</a> couldn't last more than one episode and in the second game without the power player things didn't go much better.</p><p>One upset fan wrote in a Reddit thread: "I can't be the only one shocked that nobody got the Final Jeopardy right.

I got it by going straight to the third part."</p><p>A fourth wondered: "Whenever I think Final Jeopardy is a no-brainer, nobody gets it right.

The mistake cost him&nbsp;$11,201.</p><p>Tirrell recognized the play as "The Tempest" by William Shakespeare. He ended the game with winnings of $15,399.</p><p>Pannullo reacted to his loss with a disappointed head shake.&nbsp;</p><p>He can at least boast of having the fifth-highest winnings in the game show's history and its sixth-longest streak.</p><p>He won $748,000 total and millions of fans with his <a href=#>sportsmanlike</a> approach to the game and his looks were an <a href=#>added bonus for many.</a></p><p>Seventeen of his 21 wins were "runaways," meaning by Final Jeopardy no one could catch him, making fans think he was&nbsp;<a href=#>going to keep winning.</a></p><p>He also went 48 for 49 on Daily Double clues before his last game - Cris even won by so much per game that execs called losing to him getting&nbsp;<a href=#>"Pannulo'd."</a></p><p>He revealed he took the game so seriously that he had the <a href=#>three-ingredient lunch every day</a> and would sweetly incorporate his girlfriend Heather's birthday into his final wagers.</p><p>Those who have&nbsp;<a href=#>won more games than Cris</a>&nbsp;in Jeopardy! history are&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>&nbsp;(74 games),&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>&nbsp;(40 games),&nbsp;<a href=#>Matt Amodio</a>&nbsp;(38 games),&nbsp;<a href=#>James Holzhauer</a>&nbsp;(32 games) and&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>&nbsp;(23 games).</p><p>He has won more money than Mattea, thus putting him fifth on the earnings&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">leaderboard</a>.</p><h2>'DISAPPOINTMENT FOR SURE'</h2><p>Cris said it was a "disappointment for sure" in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bonus</a>&nbsp;video.</p><p>“Any one of the Daily Doubles that I bet big on like today, I could have gotten wrong.
