Poor Sabrina’s face started melting right away. Her skin began to fall off of her face, chest, and neck. Her eyes were also blinded in an instant.</p><p>“And as I am lying there, the first thing I am thinking is, ‘Why would someone pour warm water over my face?’ ” she said.</p><p>She further added, “But a couple of seconds later, I realized it was not warm water because my skin is falling off my face, my neck, my chest, and my back.”</p><p>After Savannah attacked her, Sabrina’s then-boyfriend put her in the car and drove her to a gas station, where a gas station employee called 911.</p><p>Sabrina was rushed to the burn center in Georgia, where she was placed in a medically induced coma for two whole weeks.</p><p>Sabrina underwent skin graft surgery in which healthy skin from her chest and back were placed onto her face.</p><h3>Post-operation</h3><p>When Sabrina regained consciousness, she had a swollen face, was blinded, and couldn’t even speak properly.</p><p>She has over 20 surgeries on both of her eyes. Though not a hundred percent, she did recover her eyesight up to 60 percent.
