Since then, he has become the talk of the town with his laid-back attitude, and an Instagram filled to the brim with exotic pictures from his travels. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>His fame has also raised curiosity about his love life. And the captain isn't exactly shy about his dating exploits, either — just picky on what he wants to engage in and reveal.</p><p>He does not have a wife yet, or children, for that matter. But what he has is his eyes set on a particular woman. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Glenn Shephard’s Love Life Explored</h2><p>Shephard has not revealed every relationship he has had in the past. Even so, as someone who has spent most of his life on yachts and treading the waters, most of his romantic encounters have been on a boat.</p><p>He revealed one such relationship while talking to fans directly through text on March 15, 2022. During a <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Q&A session</a>, he was asked if he had ever dated a crew member or a charter guest.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Captain Glenn Shephard at the Expo 2020 Dubai.</strong> (Photo: Glenn Shephard/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To this, he admitted to dating a&nbsp;chief stew on a boat he used to captain before the Parsifal III, though he did not go into further details.</p><p>He's still very active with women. "I'm not married, but I'm not celibate, let's put it that way," he told <a href=# rel=follow>Andy Cohen</a> when the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">host asked</a> if he was single during the season two reunion. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The captain attracted plenty of suitors on his Instagram DMs. When pressed about that by Cohen, he responded, "Oh, yeah. I get a lot of interesting DMs. Photos, videos, you know, all kinds of invitations. It's great. I love it."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Despite these advances, Shephard has his sights set on one woman. He revealed this to Bravo TV right before season three premiered in February 2022.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"There is this one lady that I have my eye on," he said. "There is a particular woman that I'm kind of chasing." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He could not discuss that relationship in public because she did not want to become a public figure overnight. Shephard understands because he, too, is someone willing to keep things within certain boundaries.</p><h2>Why Glenn Shephard Might Not Have a Wife</h2><p>While it could be perfectly fine to speculate that Shephard does not yet have a wife because he hasn't found "the one," the true reasons behind his singlehood might lie in his career. That and his stern professionalism.</p><p>The captain has mentioned a few times on&nbsp;Below Deck Sailing Yacht the difficulty in maintaining a relationship while traveling so much. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He also tries not to cross certain professional boundaries when at work. During the seasons, he has had plenty of chances to socialize with charter guests.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During his Q&A, he recalled multiple occasions when he had the chance to hook up with guests. But he limited all those chances to platonic relationships.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>"The crew are not meant to fraternize with the guests in certain situations," he clarified. Even during time off during charters, if invited by guests to socialize, the yachties are supposed to "be discreet and not accept any advancements because that's not really meant to happen."</p><p>Even though guests and crew members are off the table, colleagues from the same network are not. And Shephard has checked out some wives from Bravo TV in the past. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>During one of his appearances on Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;in February 2022, Cohen expressed his desire to set Shephard up with one of the housewives, even providing the captain with the names of <a href=# rel=follow>Eboni K. Williams</a> and Heather Gay.</p><p>He responded, saying Williams'&nbsp;name stood out to him and even asked Cohen to "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hook him up</a>" with her. There's nothing available on that front... yet.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ%2BcmruvedKhnKmgkaexbsPIn5xnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fglenn-shephard-wife-html.html&text=On%20Glenn%20Shephards%20Love%20Life%20and%20Why%20He%20Has%20No%20Wife%20Yet&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fglenn-shephard-wife-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fglenn-shephard-wife-html.html&title=On%20Glenn%20Shephards%20Love%20Life%20and%20Why%20He%20Has%20No%20Wife%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fglenn-shephard-wife-html.html&title=On%20Glenn%20Shephards%20Love%20Life%20and%20Why%20He%20Has%20No%20Wife%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fglenn-shephard-wife-html.html&title=On%20Glenn%20Shephards%20Love%20Life%20and%20Why%20He%20Has%20No%20Wife%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fglenn-shephard-wife-html.html&description=On%20Glenn%20Shephards%20Love%20Life%20and%20Why%20He%20Has%20No%20Wife%20Yet" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paula-reto.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paula Reto- Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./90-day-fiance-the-other-way-holly-feels-betrayed-wayne-reveals-money-issues-ditches-her-side-of-road-7852827.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Holly Feels 'Betrayed' by Wayne's Secrecy, Abandonment">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
