She was also accused of providing false information to authorities.</p><p>At the time, her parents, <a href=#>Cindy and George Anthony</a>, stood behind their daughter. They were eager to get to the bottom of their 2-year-old granddaughter Caylee's disappearance and death, and they were in the public eye almost as much as Casey Anthony herself.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Anthony was found not guilty on all charges except for providing false information to law enforcement. During her incarceration for the duration of her trial, she alternated between seeing her parents and avoiding them completely. Her attorney <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose Baez</a> accused George Anthony of sexually abusing his own daughter.</p><p>In November 2022, Anthony herself expanded on the alleged abuse in a Peacock series titled Casey Anthony: Where the Truth Lies. In it, Anthony claimed that her father not only molested her as a child but was also abusing Caylee and was responsible for her death. She also claimed George then covered it up.</p><p>Where are Casey Anthony's parents now?

In January 2024, A&E is airing Casey Anthony’s Parents: The Lie Detector Test in an effort to give the couple an opportunity to respond to the alleged abuse Anthony detailed in the Peacock series. The two-hour special features Anthony's parents hooked up to a polygraph machine as they answer various questions about Caylee's death and Anthony's claims.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Casey Anthony’s explosive accusations that her father molested Casey and Caylee and that he is responsible for Caylee’s death, prompted George and Cindy’s decision to undergo lie detector tests," said A&E in a press release. "Their real-time responses to the polygraph questions are laid bare in the documentary along with each spouse’s reaction to the other’s answers and the lie detector results."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The special is hosted by Emmy Award–winning journalist and filmmaker Tony Harris, who spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WGN-TV</a> about George and Cindy's decision to come forward. When asked by WGN Morning News co-host Robin Baumgarten about the fact that lie detector tests are not admissible in court, Tony said a polygraph test has about a "90 percent reliability." In his opinion, George and Cindy felt that taking a lie detector test was their only option. He also said they are absolutely putting themselves at risk by opening themselves up to further scrutiny.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Casey Anthony's life has taken several turns since her trial.</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, Anthony remains estranged from both her parents. Since the trial ended in July 2011, Anthony has certainly struggled to find some stability. She once reportedly attempted to start a photography business, which didn't really take off.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Anthony "filed paperwork to open a private investigation company in South Florida" in December 2020, "listing herself as a registered agent of Case Research & Consulting Services, LLC." The address associated with the business belongs to the home of Patrick McKenna, the "lead investigator for her defense team in her 2011 trial." It's unclear if anything has happened with this business in the years since Anthony filed the paperwork.</p><p>In May 2021, Casey Anthony was involved <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a bar fight</a> with another woman during which they had a verbal altercation because they had apparently been dating the same man. Casey Anthony called 9-1-1 to report that the woman had allegedly been stalking her and, just like that, her name was once again in the news. Since the release of the Peacock series in November 2022, Anthony has remained out of the public eye.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK60sdhmmKesmKS7unnPmqmepqSoeq%2B71g%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcasey-anthony-parents-now.html&text=Casey%20Anthony%27s%20Parents%20Now%3a%20They%20Respond%20to%20Accusations&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcasey-anthony-parents-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcasey-anthony-parents-now.html&title=Casey%20Anthony%27s%20Parents%20Now%3a%20They%20Respond%20to%20Accusations" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcasey-anthony-parents-now.html&title=Casey%20Anthony%27s%20Parents%20Now%3a%20They%20Respond%20to%20Accusations" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcasey-anthony-parents-now.html&title=Casey%20Anthony%27s%20Parents%20Now%3a%20They%20Respond%20to%20Accusations" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcasey-anthony-parents-now.html&description=Casey%20Anthony%27s%20Parents%20Now%3a%20They%20Respond%20to%20Accusations" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./danny-simmons.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Danny Simmons net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./afewerk-tekle-19321022-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Afewerk Tekle (Painter) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
