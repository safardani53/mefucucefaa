He has been playing the sport since his teenage years and has achieved great heights through his skills.</p><p>Likewise, his popularity has skyrocketed in the last year thanks to a couple of things. The first thing was the showoff/rivalry between him and his younger brother, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/travis-kelce/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Kelce</a>, during last season’s Super Bowl — Travis is signed with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p>The second thing that increased Jason’s popularity was his brother Travis’ love life. In 2023, Travis began dating the 12-time Grammy Award winner <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/taylor-swift/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a>, after which everything related to Travis and the Kelce family blew up to epic proportions.</p><p>As Jason is very close to his younger brother – they even co-host a podcast together – netizens, especially Swifties, began to dig deep about Jason. And one of the things that they want to know is about Jason’s earnings, net worth, and house. So, let’s dive in!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Kelce’s salary and net worth breakdown</h2><p>Jason’s journey in American football started at a young age, and he earned big accolades while playing for his high school team. His tremendous form continued while playing for his college team, as he further elevated his game performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jason-Kelce-wife-children.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jason Kelce with his wife, Kylie Kelce, and their kids at the Novacare Eagles Training Complex (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>During his college days, he was a two-time Second-team All-Big East selection. His skills attracted many teams from the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/nfl/ rel="noreferrer noopener">NFL</a>, and during the 2011 NFL Draft, he was picked by the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/philadelphia-eagles/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia Eagles</a> in the sixth round.</p><p>Since getting picked, he has continued to prove his worth. Likewise, he has started in all 186 games that he has played with the Eagles. Speaking of his accolades with the Eagles, Jason is a Super Bowl champion, five-time first-team All-Pro selection, and six-time Pro Bowl selection.&nbsp;</p><p>All this has resulted in him being regarded as one of the greatest centers in NFL history. Considering all that, it must be sure that the Eagles have been paying Jason a considerable salary that has been keeping talent like him in the team since 2011.</p><p>So, how much is his salary? And what’s his net worth? If we look at his contract with the Eagles, he initially <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://overthecap.com/player/jason-kelce/755 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">signed</a> a four-year $2.13 million contract on July 27, 2011. The deal included a $97,432 signing bonus and an average annual salary of $534,358.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jason-Kelce-fundraiser-Be-Philly-Foundation.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jason Kelce during a fundraiser for Be Philly Foundation in 2023 (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>On February 27, 2014, Jason renegotiated and signed a new contract with the NFL team. According to agent Jason Bernstein, his new contract with the Eagles was a six-year, $37.5 million contract extension, with $13 million guaranteed.</p><p>On March 2, 2019, he signed a one-year $24.5 million contract extension, including $10.5 million guaranteed, through the 2021 season. On March 5, 2021, he signed another one-year $9 million contract with the Eagles.</p><p>During the 2022 offseason, the 36-year-old Jason mulled over his retirement but signed a one-year $14 million contract extension on March 11, 2022. This new deal made Jason the highest-paid center in the NFL.</p><p>After the one-year contract expired, the NFL star considered retirement again but eventually signed a one-year contract. His new deal is worth $14.25 million, with a base salary of $1,165,000, a $10,335,000 signing bonus, and $14,250,000 guaranteed overall.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Considering Jason’s salary over the years, he must have accumulated a huge net worth. <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/nfl/jason-kelce-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that his net worth in 2023 is $30 million, which is $10 million less than his younger brother <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/nfl/travis-kelce-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Travis’ net worth</a>, which is $40 million.</p><p>That said, Jason’s net worth isn’t only comprised of his salary and benefits from his NFL contract with the Eagles. Jason is one of the most popular centers in NFL history, which means many companies have approached him for brand endorsements.</p><p>Through those brand endorsements, he has been able to increase his income. Speaking of the figures, it has been <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1661075/jason-kelce-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> that he makes around or more than a million from brand endorsements. Likewise, he has been in commercials for different brands.</p><p>Another off-NFL income source for Jason is his weekly podcast with Travis, New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce. And as of now, their podcast has featured many sponsors, including State Farm and Buffalo Wild Wings.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Furthermore, Jason and his family were recently featured in a documentary titled Kelce, and it managed to be the most-watched documentary on Prime Video. To conclude, Jason has numerous income sources that have and will increase his net worth for years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Kelce’s house: Where does the NFL star live?</h2><p>By now, Jason’s salary and net worth figures are clear, and it’s sure that with all the money he has, the NFL star has a lavish place to live. And that’s correct, as Jason is also keen on real estate investments.</p><p>As of this writing, Jason has <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/jason-kelce-house rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multiple houses</a> on his real estate portfolio, which has also increased his wealth. The first one on the list is the house he presently lives in, located in Haverford Township, Pennsylvania.</p><p>He bought the property, which sits on a one-acre lot, in January 2018 for $680,000 — the four-bedroom home was initially listed for $800,000 in May 2017. The same year, he bought a three-unit rental house in Cleveland, Ohio, for $160,000.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jason-Kelce-house-backyard.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jason Kelce standing in the backyard of his house (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>He made another purchase two years after he bought his house in Haverford Township. This purchase was right next to his home, and the four-bedroom home on eight acres cost him $3.96 million — the deal was finalized in September 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Last summer, in mid-2022, Jason added to his real estate holdings when he spent $2.2 million for a four-bedroom home in Sea Isle City. His latest purchase is a three-story townhouse with multiple decks, one block from the beach, and excellent views.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK570qmmq6yjZLeiv86nZKSdnJiybrrErWSwp6KptW6%2FwKWYq7Fdnby2v8Ro</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjason-kelce-net-worth-salary-house.html&text=Inside%20NFL%20Star%20Jason%20Kelces%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20And%20House&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjason-kelce-net-worth-salary-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjason-kelce-net-worth-salary-house.html&title=Inside%20NFL%20Star%20Jason%20Kelces%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20And%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjason-kelce-net-worth-salary-house.html&title=Inside%20NFL%20Star%20Jason%20Kelces%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20And%20House" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjason-kelce-net-worth-salary-house.html&title=Inside%20NFL%20Star%20Jason%20Kelces%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20And%20House" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjason-kelce-net-worth-salary-house.html&description=Inside%20NFL%20Star%20Jason%20Kelces%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20And%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./married-to-medicine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Married to Medicine: Latest news, updates and rumors">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./holly-frazier.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Holly Frazier">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
