But … I don’t like to upset <strong>Andy [Cohen]</strong> by interrupting.”</p><p class=p1>Meredith and her <i>RHOSLC</i> costars <a href=#>filmed the reunion special</a> —&nbsp; which is set to air in January 2024 — late last month. While devoted fans won’t know exactly what was covered during taping until the broadcast airs, Meredith hinted she didn’t get “closure” regarding her friendship breakdown with <a href=#><strong>Lisa Barlow</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s not so much bothersome, but I would love a little bit of closure. I feel like Lisa and I definitely had some underlying conflicts,” Meredith confessed on Tuesday. “Some were not so underlying that I don’t feel like we really touched on at all [during the reunion].”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “It’s not to say that we don’t have some sense of resolution because I think we both understand, in seeing things play back and everything else, that there were other parties involved that exacerbated the situation, which I think has pretty much gone on with me and her every year. So, I think she and I are mentally at a place of understanding, but it’s not something that we’ve really talked about.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Meredith-Marks-Says-She-and-Lisa-Barlow-Had-Unresolved-Underlying-Conflicts-After-RHOSLC-Reunion-01.jpg><p class=p1>Meredith and Lisa, 48, were inseparable besties when <i>RHOSLC </i>debuted its first season in November 2020. Their bond dissipated in season 2 after Lisa’s <a href=#>infamous hot mic moment</a>, where she dropped serious allegations about Meredith, her family and her home after storming out of the party. Lisa eventually apologized at the season 2 reunion, and the ladies’ friendship was seemingly back on track in season 3.</p><p class=p1>Early in season 4, which is currently airing, <a href=#>Meredith and Lisa made it clear</a> that they no longer want to foster a feud, but their dynamic may change <a href=#>in the remaining episodes.</a></p><p class=p1>“It’s about finding footing in a new relationship that works for us. And the place that we’re in now, trying to go backward, I think is unhealthy for both of us,” Meredith told <i>Us</i>, noting their bond will likely never go back to what it was. “I don’t have the same level of trust that we had years ago. Yes, I have a certain level of trust with certain things and other things, not as much. You just have to build and grow, and it’s going to take time.”</p><p class=p1>For Meredith, mending fences is more about whether she and Lisa can “come to terms” and develop a “high enough level of trust” again.</p><p class=p1>“We don’t have to have trust 100 percent [now],” she said on Tuesday. “We have to be at some level where we have enough trust within each other that we can give [the] benefit of the doubt [and] we’re able to have a discussion with each other rather than letting someone else get in our ear and exacerbate some feelings we may be having.”</p><p class=p1>Meredith refused to identify the <i>RHOSLC </i>cast members who’ve caused friction in her friendship with Lisa.</p><p class=p1>“I think that there has been meddling in our friendship since season 1. I mean, I don’t think this is anything new,” she added. “It feels like it’s almost everybody at some level. I don’t know if I can point fingers, so to speak, because it gets confusing and everyone always wants to point a finger. At the end of the day, I really don’t care.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City </i>airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSeqpWZtrW0jKaYq6OjYrWiv4yupaudo6S5t7HDZqCsq6WawG7DyK2fZqSZqK5ursCro6ivXZaztbHRZqmerZ6evK97</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeredith-marks-has-unresolved-issues-with-lisa-barlow-after-reunion.html&text=Meredith%20Marks%20Has%20Unresolved%20Issues%20With%20Lisa%20Barlow%20After%20Reunion&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeredith-marks-has-unresolved-issues-with-lisa-barlow-after-reunion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeredith-marks-has-unresolved-issues-with-lisa-barlow-after-reunion.html&title=Meredith%20Marks%20Has%20Unresolved%20Issues%20With%20Lisa%20Barlow%20After%20Reunion" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeredith-marks-has-unresolved-issues-with-lisa-barlow-after-reunion.html&title=Meredith%20Marks%20Has%20Unresolved%20Issues%20With%20Lisa%20Barlow%20After%20Reunion" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeredith-marks-has-unresolved-issues-with-lisa-barlow-after-reunion.html&title=Meredith%20Marks%20Has%20Unresolved%20Issues%20With%20Lisa%20Barlow%20After%20Reunion" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeredith-marks-has-unresolved-issues-with-lisa-barlow-after-reunion.html&description=Meredith%20Marks%20Has%20Unresolved%20Issues%20With%20Lisa%20Barlow%20After%20Reunion" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./radiant-kate-middleton-royal-ascot-dress-racing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Radiant Kate Middleton turns heads at Royal Ascot in a vibrant red dress and stylish hat for Day Fou">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kelly-graves.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kelly Graves">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
