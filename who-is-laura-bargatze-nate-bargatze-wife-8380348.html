During the early years of their relationship, he got his career off the ground by attending comedy college in Chicago, handing out flyers as a “barker” in New York City and eventually moving to Los Angeles where he kept fine-tuning his craft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, Nate has appeared in the Netflix specials The Tennessee Kid in 2019 and The Greatest Average American in 2021 — the latter earned him a nomination at the 2022 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Grammy Awards</a>. The comedian then kicked off 2023 with his Prime Video special Hello World and he was tapped to host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Saturday Night Live</a>, a gig he called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>“beyond a dream come true”</a> on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout it all, Laura has been by his side, along with their daughter, Harper. “I never had any doubt that our life would work out, whether he chose not to do comedy or found a job or some other career path,” she shared on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Nateland Podcast</a> in 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who is Nate Bargatze’s wife? Here is everything to know about Laura Bargatze and her relationship with the comedian.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nate-and-laura-met-while-working-at-applebees></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Nate and Laura met while working at Applebee’s</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Nate Bargatze poses for a photo with Laura Bargatze.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nate Bargatze Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Nate has been a comedian for over 20 years, his relationship with Laura had more humble beginnings: The two met in their early 20s while working together at an Applebee’s restaurant in Tennessee. Nate was a host, while Laura was a server — roles he would later joke about in The Greatest Average American.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Someone asked [Laura] recently … did you ever imagine when you started dating that your lives would become all that it’s become?” he recalled in the stand-up special.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nate continued, “She said, ‘When I met him, he was a host and I didn’t think he was smart enough to be a server. So, yeah — we’ve got a little bit farther than I expected.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, he impressed her in a memorable way. Speaking on The Nateland Podcast, Laura said he caught her eye one night when they went out with fellow Applebee’s employees after work, and he silenced everyone for a specific reason.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He put in The Little Mermaid soundtrack and told his friends to, like, ‘Shush, shush, I’m listening to this song,’ ” she said. “I was like, if anyone could put in The Little Mermaid soundtrack and shush a bunch of 20 year olds … to be quiet while he sings it. I thought that was totally confident.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-laura-was-supportive-of-his-comedy-ambitions></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Laura was supportive of his comedy ambitions</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Nate Bargatze sitting with his wife Laura Bargatze at Red Rocks Amphitheatre.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nate Bargatze Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nate moved on from Applebee’s to work as a meter reader for a water company, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety reported</a>. He and Laura were still dating, and it seemed to be the start of a stable career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had great benefits. I wasn’t the best at school, so this was a solid job you can have for the rest of your life,” he told the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, as a high school senior, Nate had a different vision for his adult life. When asked where he would be in 10 years, he wrote that he’d “play Zanie’s,” the famed Chicago comedy club. So, when Nate and a friend learned about a comedy college in Chicago, he decided to ditch his county job and pursue stand-up — and Laura was fully supportive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He said, ‘I have to tell you something,’ and … my mind is racing. Just, like, what could it be,” she said on The Nateland Podcast. “He’s like, ‘I want to be a stand-up comedian.’ And I was like, okay, alright … do that!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had a good feeling about it,” Laura added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Today, Nate considers her support critical to his success. “If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend that is going to be in the way, then you gotta choose,” he added on The Nateland Podcast. “This is a thing that’s a commitment … You’ve got to make sacrifices to hopefully live a life that nobody gets to live.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-theyve-been-married-since-2006></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>They’ve been married since 2006</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Comedian Nate Bargatze with his wife Laura Bargatze at an event in April 2023 in Nashville, Tennessee.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jason Kempin/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nate proposed to Laura in 2005 while he was pursuing comedy in N.Y.C., and she was living and working in Tennessee. During a visit, he popped the question to her on a carriage ride through Central Park, they revealed on The Nateland Podcast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was completely shocked,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They tied the knot on Oct. 13, 2006 —&nbsp;and their wedding day fell on Friday the 13th, which Nate would later joke about in The Tennessee Kid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We got married on Friday the 13th. Got a pretty sweet deal on that,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he quipped</a>. “They were wide open. We were like, ‘What times are available?’ They go, ‘Every one of ‘em. All 24. You can call us that day if you want.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to their wedding date, Nate spoke more about their nuptials, revealing how his mom and Laura planned the wedding — and that “they’re both cheap.” One area where it was particularly obvious that they cut corners was the DJ, who Nate’s mother hired.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Our DJ was awful,” Nate said. “He got super drunk [and] played the same song three times in a row.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Outside of his stand-up material, though, Nate commemorates his and Laura’s union on social media with touching sentiments. When the couple celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary in October, he wrote a loving message <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>on Instagram</a> to his wife of nearly two decades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Friday the 13th turned out to be ok,” Nate wrote alongside a picture of the couple with their daughter, Harper. “I couldn’t have done any of this without you.

Awesome day,” he captioned a picture of their newborn in a hospital bassinet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As she’s grown older, Harper has returned the favor for her father.

(<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chelsea Handler</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Louis C.K.</a>, Lewis Black, Lavell Crawford and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kevin Hart</a> were also nominated in the category.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nate was also a presenter at the Hollywood event. He later posted photos of himself and Laura on the red carpet and at the awards show on his Instagram account. Although he didn't take home the win, the comedian put jokes aside to compliment his date to the Grammys.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My wife looked beautiful.

He worked as a dog walker and drove a FedEx truck during the day. The aspiring performer also handed out flyers for the Boston Comedy Club at night in exchange for free stage time at the end of the night, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Atlantic</a>. But neither Nate nor Laura envisioned staying long-term.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It kind of starts to wear on you a little bit,” Laura said about their time in N.Y.C. on The Nateland Podcast. “We were broke at that point, and New York’s not that fun if you don’t have some spending cash.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-114 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for Nate, he knew it was time to make a move when he got too comfortable doing comedy, he revealed to Variety.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-116 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I could play everywhere, do spots at all the clubs,” he said. So, the couple decided to move to L.A. in 2012. But, two years later, Nate and Laura made the decision to quietly move back to Nashville, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Tennessean</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-118 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My biggest fear was, ‘They’re going to think I quit,’ ” Nate shared. “So I just didn’t say anything. When I [would travel] to L.A., my manager knew, but I didn’t want somebody to not want to meet with me because I didn’t live there.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-120 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple currently live about 25 minutes south of Nashville, per Variety. Nate spoke more about their move back to Tennessee to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nashville Scene</a> in 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-122 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Once I started touring a lot, and I was going to all these clubs, and almost every weekend you’re working somewhere else,” he shared. “I realized, my whole family is still here, my wife’s from Alabama, her family’s like an hour from here.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-124 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“So I was like, ‘You know what, I just want to go home,’ ” he added.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6edvG610majmq2ilnqjrdGgmK2ylWK7osDEZpmaqpeWwbuxjLCgn51dbYB5fJJtbw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-laura-bargatze-nate-bargatze-wife-8380348.html&text=Who%20Is%20Nate%20Bargatzes%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Laura%20Bargatze&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-laura-bargatze-nate-bargatze-wife-8380348.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-laura-bargatze-nate-bargatze-wife-8380348.html&title=Who%20Is%20Nate%20Bargatzes%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Laura%20Bargatze" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-laura-bargatze-nate-bargatze-wife-8380348.html&title=Who%20Is%20Nate%20Bargatzes%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Laura%20Bargatze" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-laura-bargatze-nate-bargatze-wife-8380348.html&title=Who%20Is%20Nate%20Bargatzes%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Laura%20Bargatze" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-laura-bargatze-nate-bargatze-wife-8380348.html&description=Who%20Is%20Nate%20Bargatzes%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Laura%20Bargatze" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./octavia-spencer-partner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does 'Thunder Force' Actress Octavia Spencer Have a Partner?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pic-minnie-driver-42-shows-off-sexy-bikini-body-201234.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PIC: Minnie Driver, 42, Shows Off Sexy Bikini Body">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
