Dark matter is the beautiful mystery of our universe,” Grimes explained.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Sideræl, which Grimes pronounced “sigh-deer-ee-el,” is a “more elven” spelling of sidereal, the “true time of the universe, star time, deep space time, not our relative earth time,” the singer added.</p><p>According to Grimes, the name choice also references her favorite&nbsp;Lord of the Rings&nbsp;character, Galadriel, who she noted “chooses to abdicate the ring.”</p><p>The Kill V Maim singer also revealed that the pair want more kids, telling Vanity Fair that they’ve “always wanted at least three or four.”</p><p>Initially, Grimes confirmed to the publication that she was back with the Tesla boss; however, the singer later revealed on social media that she and Musk have split again.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>“Me and E have broken up again since the writing of this article haha, but he’s my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now,” Grimes tweeted Thursday.</p><p>“I think Devin wrote that part of the story rly well. Sique – peace out.”</p><h2 id=semi-separated>SEMI-SEPARATED</h2><p>Last September the pair announced they were "semi separated" after Grimes said Musk had been "very immature on Twitter".</p><p>“We are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently, and are on great terms,”&nbsp;Elon&nbsp;told Page Six at the time.</p><p>“It’s mostly that my work at SpaceX and&nbsp;<a href=#>Tesla</a>&nbsp;requires me to be primarily in Texas or traveling overseas and her work is primarily in LA."</p><p>The couple, who started dating in 2018, announced they were pregnancy with their first child together in January of 2020.</p><p>They had made their debut at the Met Gala in May 2018.</p><h2 id=complicated-pregnancy>COMPLICATED PREGNANCY</h2><p>Grimes said she had hemorrhaged during her pregnancy and was left "crawling" to the bathroom.</p><p>Shortly after the birth pf the their first child she was "recovering from surgery and barely alive."</p><p>That came after Musk pointed out she had misspelled the precursor to the couple's "favorite aircraft".</p><p>Just four days before she went into labor, the SpaceX founder tweeted: "Grimes is mad at me" after he wrote that he was selling almost all of his physical possessions.</p><p>Then in July last year, the couple had a very public falling out when the Tesla magnate announced that "pronouns suck."</p><h2 id=online-spat>ONLINE SPAT</h2><p>Less than impressed by his bold social media statement, Grimes, whose real name is Claire Boucher, replied: "I love you but please turn off ur phone or give me a dall [sic].</p><p>"I cannot support hate. Please stop this. I know this isn't your heart.”</p><p>Although the artist quickly deleted the reply, Musk unfollowed his girlfriend the following day.</p><p>But apparently, the pair were able to work things out as he re-followed her just seven hours later.</p><p>Musk also reportedly<a href=#> angered her mom Sandy Garossino</a> when he encouraged followers to&nbsp;<a href=#>"take the red pill"</a>, a phrase used by the far right to signify a political awakening.</p><h2 id=third-marriage>THIRD MARRIAGE</h2><p>Tech billionaire Musk already has five sons with with his former wife, Justine Wilson.</p><p>Grimes and Musk had initially named their&nbsp;<a href=#>son X Æ A-12</a>.</p><p>The name appeared to be partially inspired by one of the songs from 33-year-old&nbsp;Grimes' last album – 4ÆM.</p><p>Unfortunately for the pair, the name was not in accordance with California state law, as the law prohibits Indo-Arabic numerals in names.</p><p>To comply with the law, they changed the name to X Æ A-Xii.</p><p>In an interview for Joe Rogan's podcast, Musk revealed the pronunciation of his son's name.</p><p>He told Rogan that it is pronounced&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Ash-A-Twelve</a>.</p><p>After he and his first wife divorced, Musk married&nbsp;English actress Talulah Riley in 2010 and remarried her in 2013 after the pair briefly divorced in 2012.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The pair divorced for the second time in October 2016.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Actress Amber Heard, who is divorced from Johnny Depp, was in an on-off relationship with Musk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000581202855-1.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoR6fJhubXJnmJ6xpbHNZqSemZ6eu6h5xKWmp2WdqsCsecaroKado2LApq%2FOp5tmmpGXxrR5zZqknmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhidden-meaning-elon-musk-grimes-second-babys-name.html&text=Hidden%20meaning%20behind%20Elon%20Musk%20and%20Grimes%27%20secret%20second%20baby%27s%20name%20revealed%20as%20singer%20says%20tycoon&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhidden-meaning-elon-musk-grimes-second-babys-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhidden-meaning-elon-musk-grimes-second-babys-name.html&title=Hidden%20meaning%20behind%20Elon%20Musk%20and%20Grimes%27%20secret%20second%20baby%27s%20name%20revealed%20as%20singer%20says%20tycoon" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhidden-meaning-elon-musk-grimes-second-babys-name.html&title=Hidden%20meaning%20behind%20Elon%20Musk%20and%20Grimes%27%20secret%20second%20baby%27s%20name%20revealed%20as%20singer%20says%20tycoon" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhidden-meaning-elon-musk-grimes-second-babys-name.html&title=Hidden%20meaning%20behind%20Elon%20Musk%20and%20Grimes%27%20secret%20second%20baby%27s%20name%20revealed%20as%20singer%20says%20tycoon" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhidden-meaning-elon-musk-grimes-second-babys-name.html&description=Hidden%20meaning%20behind%20Elon%20Musk%20and%20Grimes%27%20secret%20second%20baby%27s%20name%20revealed%20as%20singer%20says%20tycoon" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-lautaro-martinez-almost-quit-football-because-of-homesickness-the-racing-inter-liniers-and-barcelona-transfer-game-included-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Lautaro Martinez Almost Quit Football Because of Homesickness?
