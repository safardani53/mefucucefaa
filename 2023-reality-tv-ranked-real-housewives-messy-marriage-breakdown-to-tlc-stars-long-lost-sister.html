It’s only natural to round off the year with a run-down of nine reality TV shows ranked from best to worst. From specific dramas within hit shows to our overall thoughts following the arrival of new series, let’s take a look at what’s gone down over the past 12 months.</strong></p><p>Of course, any <a href=#>reality TV</a> roundup wouldn’t be complete without a helping of Real Housewives, a dash of Winter House, a sprinkling of Love is Blind, and a solid dose of <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>. Some of the Bravolebrities and celebrities alike have brought their A-game to their respective shows, while others were, quite frankly, a flop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-20-at-12.54.48-1024x535.png><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2023-reality-tv-ranked-rhobh-kyle-and-mauricio>2023 Reality TV ranked – RHOBH Kyle and Mauricio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/12/GettyImages-1484341032-1024x683.jpg><p><a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> wasn’t the first Real Housewives show to launch on Bravo, but it’s certainly up there with fans’ favorites.</p><p>The ladies are dripping in diamonds and some, such as <a href=#>Kyle Richards</a>, are boasting net worths of hundreds of millions of dollars, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">per</a> Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>Kyle’s financial life may be rolling along smoothly thanks to her Real Housewives <a href=#>salary and acting gigs</a> on the side, but her love life took a shock turn in 2023.</p><p>In the summer, news broke that Kyle and her husband, whom she married in 1996, had “separated.”</p><p>As it stands, the two haven’t made things crystal clear about where their relationship is today.</p><p>But, the RHOBH star did <a href=#>break down in tears at BravoCon</a> this year when talking about her marriage.</p><p>To round off the year, Kyle took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> this December to wish her followers a Happy Christmas, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">writing</a>: “To my 4 daughters, you bring me happiness every day.

Absolutely not.</p><p>Whitney Way Thore, her brother, Hunter Thore, and father Glenn Thore all star in the <a href=#>TLC</a> show. Sadly, Whitney and Hunter’s mother, Babs, passed away in 2022. Babs’ funeral was show during MBFFL season 11 which was somewhat controversial for some viewers.</p><p>In the midst of mourning the loss of his wife, Glenn goes about ticking things off his bucket list and ends up being reconnected with his long-lost daughter.</p><p>His daughter, Angie, was born before he welcomed Whitney and Hunter with Babs.</p><p>The bombshell news was a huge deal to the family and fans who watched the show. <a href=#>Whitney was thriving in her “auntie era”</a> after finding out Angie had kids.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2023-reality-tv-ranked-the-kardashians>2023 Reality TV ranked – The Kardashians</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/12/Copy-of-Templates-169-2-1024x559.png><p>The Kardashians Hulu series came through with one major moment this year.</p><p>After the whole family had to tread lightly following <a href=#>Tristan Thompson</a>‘s cheating scandal, Kourtney Kardashian finally got to have her say about her younger sister, <a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a>.</p><p>Fans had been waiting for years for someone to tell Tristan straight and many gave kudos to Kourtney Kardashian for saying her piece.</p><p>Speaking to her sister’s ex, <a href=#>Kourtney aired her true feelings</a>, saying she didn’t think he was “good enough for Khloé.”</p><p>One fan tweeted of the moment: “Kourtney isn’t my favorite but I appreciate her not letting Tristan off the hook like the rest of the family.”</p><p>Outside of the family’s Hulu show, <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> has had her fans hooked this year on her romance with actor Timothée Chalamet. The two were spotted laying on the PDA at multiple points during the year but they still haven’t gone “Instagram-official.”</p><p><a href=#>Fan theories the two have “split”</a> and romance rekindling rumors are often circulating but it’s safe to say the Kylie Cosmetics founder is keeping her followers on their toes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-celebs-go-dating>Celebs Go Dating</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/09/Templates-169-14-1024x559.png><p>Hopping across the pond from the USA to the UK, Channel 4’s <a href=#>Celebs Go Dating</a> really brought it back this year.</p><p>While some seasons of the dating show have seen some questionable celebrities taking part, in series 12, the dating agency had some top-tier matchmaking to do.</p><p>The reality show came complete with a side helping of drama as <a href=#>two of the celebrities ended up falling</a> for one another – Adam Collard and Lottie Moss.</p><p>Besides Adam and Lottie’s antics, viewers were also kept entertained by Vanessa Feltz, Chloe Burrows, Mark-Francis Vandelli, and Spuddz.</p><p>At the end of the 2023 series, <a href=#>Spuddz and Gabby sealed their relationship</a> with a kiss but it appears the two aren’t together anymore as they don’t follow each other on Instagram.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sister-wives>Sister Wives</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-30-at-15.45.17-1024x503.png><p>Venturing back over the the USA, hit TLC series <a href=#>Sister Wives</a> was also coming through with the major drama this year.</p><p>After Christine and <a href=#>Kody Brown</a> went their separate ways two years ago, it seemingly started the breakdown of his relationships with more of his wives.</p><p>Now, Kody has one remaining wife, <a href=#>Robyn Brown</a>, and season 18 was pretty jam-packed with all kinds of ups and downs for the family.</p><p>He and Janelle argued over Christmas plans and Kody ended up storming out on his former wife. A family <a href=#>“secret” kept for 13 years</a> was also revealed during this year’s show leaving Meri Brown feeling frustrated.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2023-reality-tv-ranked-dubai-bling>2023 Reality TV ranked – Dubai Bling</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/12/GettyImages-1435129184-1024x683.jpg><p>As we enter the middle realm of the rankings, we buckle up for the more disappointing series released this year. Netflix viewers were treated to a new instalment of <a href=#>Dubai Bling</a> this winter.</p><p>While there were some new storylines to sink our teeth into, the same ones still lingered on, including some uncomfortable argument scenes.</p><p>There are only so many <a href=#>Ebraheem Al Samadi</a> and Zeina Khoury fight scenes we can take.</p><p>The <a href=#>lavish lives of the cast members</a> are still pretty impressive, but how they might continue into another season is a real question.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-love-is-blind>Love Is Blind</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-24-at-17.26.34-e1703439345419.png><p>Another <a href=#>Netflix</a> release, Love Is Blind, had its explosive moments in season 5 – granted. But, the drama was almost too chaotic to handle.</p><p>The awkwardness began in the pods, with Uche Okoroha and Aaliyah Cosby’s initial connection being smashed to smithereens after the bombshell came out that <a href=#>Lydia Velez Gonzalez had dated Uche</a> in real life outside of the show.</p><p>Besides that, as the season went on, fans had to endure the Taylor Rue and JP Pierce bizarre relationship breakdown as well as <a href=#>Stacy Snyder and Izzy Zapata’s financial chats</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-golden-bachelor>Golden Bachelor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/12/GettyImages-1689520239-1024x682.jpg><p>The Golden <a href=#>Bachelor</a> was music to reality TV lovers’ ears when news first broke of the concept.</p><p>But, in practice, it turns out getting long in the tooth could come with some skeletons in the closet. More than some of the other Bachelor Nation stars, anyway.</p><p>The Daily Mail <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a> Gerry “fibbed” about not dating after his late wife’s death in 2017.</p><p>While Gerry had some sweet moments with his co-stars and ended up finding love, the ‘Bachelor for oldies’ wasn’t our favorite show this year.</p><p>We did have a good laugh at <a href=#>Aunt Chippy taking a nap</a> and Sandra Mason letting one go on camera, though.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2023-reality-tv-ranked-winter-house>2023 Reality TV ranked – Winter House</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-20-at-12.58.35-1024x463.png><p>With so many Bravolebrities getting involved in Winter House season 3, it seemed the perfect combination of people for the show to take off.</p><p>However, aside from some <a href=#>cringe-worthy scenes of romances</a> formed on the two-week snowy vacation, it didn’t seem to be bringing much to the table this winter.</p><p>To top it off, <a href=#>episode 9 had a blip on Peacock</a> as it was taken down after being released.
