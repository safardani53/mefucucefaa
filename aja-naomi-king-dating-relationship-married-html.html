She attended Yale University’s School of Drama in 2010 and performed in several productions like Little Shop of Horrors, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Brittany Renner Wiki: Amid Baby Daddy & Dating </a><a href=# rel=follow>Dilemma</a><a href=# rel=follow>, Who Is Boyfriend?</a></p><p>With the support of her parents, Aja successfully made her television debut in the CBS police procedural, Blue Bloods in 2010 and eventually made her feature film debut in Damsels in Distress in 2011. It was in 2012 that Aja landed her big break as the series’ primary antagonist on the CW medical drama series Emily Owens, M.D. as Cassandra Kopelson.</p><p>The 33-year-old actress later had a recurring role in the ABC medical drama series, Black Box as Ali Henslee. She was cast as one of the lead characters in the ABC legal thriller How to Get Away with Murder in February 2014. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her fame shot to the sky when she played the female lead role in the historical drama movie, The Birth of a Nation in 2016 that was based on the story of the 1831 slave rebellion led by Nat Turner. This led to Aja as a cast in The Upside in 2017 alongside Kevin Hart as a remake of the 2011 French film, The Intouchables.</p><h2><strong>Aja Naomi’s Reaction To Her Dating Rumors with Co-star, Alfred Enoch</strong></h2><p>How to Get Away With Murder fandom has been raging with their new ship of Aja, and Alfred Enoch and the two have no problem with that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read Also:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Tempestt Bledsoe On Getting Married And Having Husband; Redefine Relationship - Then And Now</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And the dating rumor started with the picture that Aja posted on Instagram with her parents and the Harry Potter star who plays Dean Thomas, Alfred Enoch in March 2017 with the caption that indicated her love for the people in the frame. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Now, that’s something to think about.

And when Aja was confronted about the dating rumors, she didn’t accept it. However, she didn’t deny it as well. Yup, that’s definitely fishy.</p><p>I would like to clear up nothing. People could think what they want and I’m going to let them… He’s a beautiful man, and I think I’m quite a lovely young lady.
