Like her father, Savannah gravitated to the entertainment industry and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began studying acting</a> at a prestigious performing arts high school in South Florida. Soon the robust Los Angeles music scene brought her to Hollywood where Savannah worked in A&R. As of the time of this writing, Savannah is the host of the Savannah Daydreamin' Radio Hour on Sirius/XM.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Thirteen years after Savannah's burst onto the scene, Sarah Delaney Buffett was born in 1992. Like her sister and dad, Sarah dabbled in the entertainment field but she really shown brightly during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, Sarah and Jimmy started a YouTube series called "Songs You Don't Know by Heart." Each episode focused on Sarah asking her dad about a lesser-known song which was followed by a performance of it. It helped Sarah and Jimmy connect with each other and his fans.</p><p>Jimmy and Jane adopted their son Cameron in 1994. Unlike his family, Cameron prefers to live a more quiet life out of the spotlight though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram</a> tells the story of a lifelong adventure-seeker. Cameron is also married and the couple appears to be incredibly devoted to a gorgeous dog.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7auudhmma6elprBtXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwak%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjimmy-buffett-net-worth.html&text=How%20Jimmy%20Buffett%20Accumulated%20His%20Final%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjimmy-buffett-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-buffett-net-worth.html&title=How%20Jimmy%20Buffett%20Accumulated%20His%20Final%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjimmy-buffett-net-worth.html&title=How%20Jimmy%20Buffett%20Accumulated%20His%20Final%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-buffett-net-worth.html&title=How%20Jimmy%20Buffett%20Accumulated%20His%20Final%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjimmy-buffett-net-worth.html&description=How%20Jimmy%20Buffett%20Accumulated%20His%20Final%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kate-moss-playboy-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Moss Playboy News - The Hollywood Gossip">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./christina-hendricks-talks-wedding-plans-exclusive-8405681.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Hendricks Opens Up About Wedding Plans (Exclusive)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
