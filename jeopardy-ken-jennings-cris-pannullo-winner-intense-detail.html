James" often widened his lead and won his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">32 games in 2019</a>, and millions of fans for his lightning-fast abilities.</p><h2>'A LITTLE TOO HARD'</h2><p>Sean also agreed the game’s<a href=#> Final Jeopardy</a>- a triple stumper that fans had said as it aired was too difficult in 30 seconds - was unreasonable.</p><p>It read: "Like the T-U-V in Tuvalu, this landlocked country has 3 consecutive letters in its English name in alphabetic sequence."</p><p>During the October 4th episode, Cris looked confused, as did Sean - they both spent much of the time gazing up seemingly lost in thought.</p><p>None of them got the rough riddle that seemed to involve geography - figuring out landlocked countries in Asia - and linguistics in just 30 seconds.</p><p>Jacqueline wrote down 'Mongolia', Sean wrote 'Kyrgyz' and Cris 'Tajikistan' - one by one,&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48, let them down easy.</p><p>The correct response was "Afghanistan" the host explained, as the 'f-g-h' are alphabetically chronological.</p><p>One Redditor roared: "I'm sorry. If at least one person can't get Final Jeopardy the question is too esoteric."</p><p>Another agreed after it aired: "Yeah, this is one that's super easy if you have a minute or two, but very difficult to figure out in 30 seconds."</p><p>Sean agreed as well: "I do think it might have been a little too hard, unless it comes to you immediately it is iterating over two lists."</p><p>"You have to go through each country and then go through their letters it is a really tough one."</p><h2>'ALMOST A NIGHTMARE'</h2><p>The whopper of a Final Jeopardy was also even harder before producers reigned it in, Sean claimed, mercifully giving the category of "Countries in Asia" - they almost didn't.</p><p>Sean said: "Ken mentioned they weren't even going to specify it to Asia so it was made easier from the original version.</p><p>"Or not landlocked, [but] there was some specifier that [without it] was going to make it a nightmare."</p><p>The night before, Final Jeopardy <a href=#>asked for five words to be written in 30 seconds</a>.</p><p>Some fans think it's time to at least update to typing instead of <a href=#>hand-writing the last response</a> with a stylus pen, as the average on correct responses in Final Jeopardy has been low this season.</p><p>New EP Mike Davies is running with ideas like the&nbsp;<a href=#>"run the category"</a>&nbsp;cash bonus and a new Triple Jeopardy! round in the Celebrity Spinoff, but the show has not discussed reforming Final Jeopardy.</p><h2>KEN DO!</h2><p>All of that said, the first-timer scored fond memories coming in second place, and said host Ken made everyone feel like a winner.</p><p>"Ken was so funny, anytime the cameras were off. I got starstruck, 'oh jeez its Ken Jennings!'"</p><p>"When we did the rehearsal he came in and gave a pep talk, he said: 'You should be super proud of making it this far, you have nothing to be afraid of.' He got everyone in good spirits and is very likable."</p><p>"The whole morning was really great, commiserating with the joys, the disappointments, once the game started, everyone was afraid of Cris as well - he was immediately showed himself as a powerful player."</p><p>"But it was truly a delight."</p><h2>SEASON 39</h2><p>As of this Monday's $60K win, Cris now has the longest streak of Season 39 and<a href=#> highest earnings since Ryan Long.</a></p><p>Season 39 of regularly airing&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;premiered on<a href=#>&nbsp;Monday</a>, September 12th.</p><p>It's the first season that&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48, and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim</a>, 46, are officially its dual hosts having been announced as the permanent successors for&nbsp;<a href=#>the late, great Alex Trebek.</a></p><p>Ken and Mayim began regularly filling in for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=#>legendary Alex</a>&nbsp;in 2021 after his tragic 2020 passing at age 80 and a whirlwind of Season 37 celebrity guest hosts.</p><p>Ken is hosting episodes airing until January and is also presiding over the new <a href=#>Second Chance Tournament</a> airing later this month and the subsequent, weightier <a href=#>Tournament of Champions.</a></p><p>Mayim started hosting the spinoff&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;on Sundays on September 25th and is hosting the regular show in the new year.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Sean said his pick for the upcoming <a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a> are <a href=#>Amy Schneider</a> and Matt Amodio.</p><p>"I have a good feeling about Matt Amodio to do the big wagers that it takes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/contestant-tells-cris-pannullos-intense-767096690.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-10-at-4.17.55-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-10-at-4.16.27-PM.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZGZ%2BcoWWaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmabop7AbrzAp6WupJykeri1zaecq2WZo8GmutKeZJ2dpJa2rXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-cris-pannullo-winner-intense-detail.html&text=Jeopardy%21%20contestant%20tells%20all%20on%20Cris%20Pannullo%27s%20%27intense%27%20behavior%20behind%20the%20scenes%20after%20facing%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-cris-pannullo-winner-intense-detail.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-cris-pannullo-winner-intense-detail.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20contestant%20tells%20all%20on%20Cris%20Pannullo%27s%20%27intense%27%20behavior%20behind%20the%20scenes%20after%20facing%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-cris-pannullo-winner-intense-detail.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20contestant%20tells%20all%20on%20Cris%20Pannullo%27s%20%27intense%27%20behavior%20behind%20the%20scenes%20after%20facing%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-cris-pannullo-winner-intense-detail.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20contestant%20tells%20all%20on%20Cris%20Pannullo%27s%20%27intense%27%20behavior%20behind%20the%20scenes%20after%20facing%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-ken-jennings-cris-pannullo-winner-intense-detail.html&description=Jeopardy%21%20contestant%20tells%20all%20on%20Cris%20Pannullo%27s%20%27intense%27%20behavior%20behind%20the%20scenes%20after%20facing%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./neon-yellow-nail-polishes-inspired-by-kim-kardashian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Neon Yellow Nail Polishes Inspired by Kim Kardashian">&larr;
