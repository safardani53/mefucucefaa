The corduroy textured surface is comfortable to sit against while also creating visual interest as a design element.&nbsp;At 18 by 18 inches, it's the perfect size to decorate your sofa, sectional, or armchair — small enough to where it won't eat up precious real estate on your seating area, but substantial enough to make its presence known.

Inspired by beautifully woven Moroccan carpets, the Onca Black Modern Throw Pillow offers up a unique geometric design that almost makes you wish it came in a wall art option. The fabric is weighted and the size is hefty, which, together, makes the pillow feel more substantial than its price may suggest. We're also fans of how richly opaque the coloring is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>23 x 23 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Fill: </strong>Down-alternative; feather-down</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tassel-hearth--hand-with-magnolia-center-stripes-tassel-throw-pillow-dark-graycream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Tassel</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hearth & Hand with Magnolia Center Stripes Tassel Throw Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=hearth--hand-with-magnolia-center-stripes-tassel-throw-pillow-railroad-gray style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/h3BwAWpYCzcncZTOpsMKAEHvs_Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hearth--hand-with-magnolia-center-stripes-tassel-throw-pillow-railroad-gray-3de89e1a77164cd4bc672f5b20bbe076.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tassels, but make them chic. So often we see tassel throw pillows that walk the fine line of being trendy and cheesy. But this one from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hearth & Hand with Magnolia</a> —&nbsp;a Target-exclusive brand designed in collaboration with Joanna Gaines’ Magnolia — is tasteful at its core. Featuring charcoal woven panels and moderate white tassels, it's the perfect balance of being ornate but not overly so; highly reflective of the celebrity design’s taste. And, because of its neutral color palette, it's easy to pair with other pillows. One thing to note: The back of this pillow isn't patterned like the front.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>18 x 18 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Fill: </strong>100% polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-lananas-faux-fur-throw-pillow-cover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lananas Throw Pillow Cover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/kvQk-n6pednePPMwGIAK-mjNaBo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lananas-Faux-Fur-Throw-Pillow-Cover-5188846e5cee4ac383945629bc7fecd0.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're someone who gets bored of looking at the same color everyday, Lanana's Faux Fur Throw Pillow Covers are the answer. There are 14 hues to sift through (including neutrals like white, gray, and beige and more vibrant options like purple, orange, and turquoise), giving you ample styling options throughout the year. These also come in varying sizes, from 18 to 26 square inches&nbsp; —&nbsp;plus, faux fur is always a fun option to add texture to a space.

The jute-like look adds a warm, earthy edge while the water-resistant 100-percent-polypropylene material ensures it won't get damaged due to the elements. While the cover isn't removable, we like that this throw pillow comes in both rectangular- and square-shaped options for more versatility. What's more, the filling is made out of recycled plastic bottles, making it a good option for those looking to be more sustainable with their purchases.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>20 x 20, 12 x 21, 13 x 36 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Fill: </strong>100% recycled polyester</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-rectangular-novogratz-zebra-marble-body-pillow></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Rectangular</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Novogratz Zebra Marble Body Pillow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Novogratz Zebra Marble Body Pillow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/xAHvUFOt_Z6CAJ12bwGFx96UsnQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-Novogratz-Zebra-Marble-Body-Pillow-82f95049a3d74042b05232bf18fd35ee.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>The Novogratz</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After hit shows 9 by Design and Home by Novogratz, forming their own interiors line was the next natural step for husband-and-wife duo Robert and Cortney Novogratz.

The faux fur doesn't shed, and the pillow itself is the perfect way to make any room feel more luxe (without a sky-high price tag).

There are a few main fillings to consider: Down, down-feather blend, down alternative, and foam.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Down: </strong>A down throw pillow insert is made up of fibers taken from the underside of a goose or duck, explains Untener. "Down is considered the more luxurious pillow filling due to its softness, lightweight nature, and durability," she says. Down's biggest pitfall? Aside from being an animal product, many people are allergic. Also, Cutler says this type of filling will require specialized cleaning.</li><li><strong>Feather-down blend: </strong>"Feather-down blends are made of a combination of down and feathers to create a luxurious yet supportive feel," says Untener. "This type of feather is firmer, more supportive, and costs less [than down]." In terms of comfort, Untener notes that the higher the down percentage, the softer and less supportive the pillow will be. This will also require regular fluffing to ensure it retains its shape. In contrast, the higher the feather percentage, the more supportive and firm the pillow will be, says Untener, who recommends the optimal ratio of 80-percent feather and 20-percent down or 90-percent feather and 10-percent down. "These blends will give the pillow good support, softness, and have enough down to prevent the quills from poking through," she says.</li><li><strong>Down-alternative: </strong>If you're allergic to down or down-feather blends, or you simply want to steer clear from animal products, a down alternative is your best bet. Unlike down's other stand-in, foam (which tends to hold its shape well, but can feel light and insubstantial, says Cutler), down alternatives are a hypoallergenic, synthetic option that mimics the durability, softness, and look of down. Many tend to be more affordable, and they're also a solid choice for covered outdoor spaces when you're looking to bring in the same feel of your interior pillows outside, says Cutler.</li></ul><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size and Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These days it's easy to find a throw pillow in any size and shape. A traditional square throw pillow will likely be your safest option, but if your sofa has a shorter back (or if it's rectangular in shape), a rectangular lumbar pillow, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Novogratz Zebra Marble Body Pillow</a> may suit it better.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to size, Cutler tells PEOPLE &nbsp;that throw pillows tend to be in the range of 18- to 24-inch" squares. The smaller the pillow, the easier it'll be to move around. But remember: if it's too small, it may not serve a functional purpose if it's too small. And if it's too big, it may eat up space on your sofa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a good rule of thumb, Untener recommends measuring the height of the back cushion of your sofa and then adding one to three inches for your largest pillow. "For the second layer of pillows, you’ll want to choose a size that's one to three inches smaller than your large pillow to add depth," she says. Finally, if you have a large sofa or sectional, adding a lumbar pillow can add more variety.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to both Untener and Cutler, pricing for throw pillows is driven by two things: the fill and the cover. "A 100-percent down pillow insert is the most expensive filling option. Feather-down blend inserts are more affordable depending on the ratio —&nbsp;the higher the down percentage, the more expensive the pillow will be. The most affordable would either be a readily available 95-percent/feather/5-percent down blend, or the down alternative since it is a man-made fiber. In this case, I recommend the down alternative to be the most valuable for the quality and price point," says Untener.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Spending more on a pillow cover (and then buying a cheaper insert) is also one way to play it. The fabric and intricacy of the cover can play a role in price though — think of beading, material, and size. For instance, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lananas Faux Fur Throw Pillow Cover</a> is only $14 and then you can find an even less expensive insert to help keep costs down.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-d6b552e8-fa83-4d79-8d10-197417f41cf6></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How much does a good throw pillow cost?</span></p><p>The cost of a throw pillow can vary greatly. A quality large throw pillow can cost about $100 to $150 each, says Untener. While price isn't always an indicator of quality, this price range is the case for many throw pillows, so it's important to consider where it'll be placed as well as how (and how often) it'll be used. If you're trying to stretch your budget, Cutler recommends putting plain, less expensive throw pillows in the back and your decorative, more expensive options in the front. However we found many great options starting at $10.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the best filling for throw pillows?</span></p><p>Though it's personal preference, a 100-percent down filling is a great option. Cutler says down pillows offer "a denser feel and will bounce back to shape fairly readily." Plus, down doesn't require regular fluffing to maintain its shape. For a hypoallergenic option that still looks and feels like down, go for a down alternative. As for foam: It may be the cheapest option, but it can feel lumpy and unsupportive.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How many throw pillows are appropriate for a couch?</span></p><p>In many cases, it all comes down to your sofa or chair. You should consider the depth of your sofa or sectional, the style, and its location, says Cutler. "For a typical sofa with an eight-inch depth, I would use four pillows. For a longer sofa around 10 feet, I would add a lumbar pillow or two to the middle of the sofa. For a large chair, I would recommend an 18 x 18 pillow." Again, throw pillows are personal preference, and you can play around with what feels right and offers the most balance.</p><p>If you're going for a more formal look, less is more. Cutler recommends throw pillows that feature intricate details, like a unique trim or beading (think of them almost like jewelry for your sofa, says Cutler). "In a more casual room, groups of pillows of different sizes and colors can be a great way to create a variety of seating options, from someone who wants to lay down and watch TV, or a smaller person who needs extra support behind their back so they can sit comfortably," he says.</p><p>To give the illusion of a larger sofa, Cutler recommends grouping your throw pillows into the corners. If you're already working with a large sofa or sectional, you'll have more flexibility to use more throw pillows — try pairing two at each end and three in the middle, says Cutler.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michelle Rostamian</a> is a lifestyle, wellness, and beauty writer who covers a wide array of topics.
