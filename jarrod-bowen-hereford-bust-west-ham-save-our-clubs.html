Without them, the likes of Bowen might never have made it.</p><p>The <a href=#>West Ham</a> winger told SunSport: “It was a grim time. It wasn’t nice to see, especially as it was my home-town team.</p><p>“And I’m sure it’s the same feeling for Bury and Macclesfield fans.</p><p>“They weren’t massive clubs but had strong connections with their towns and had many loyal fans who were die-hards. It’s hard to accept.”</p><p>Bowen became an Edgar Street regular aged 12 but remembers watching them even younger.</p><p>At ten, he went to cheer the Bulls with his Leominster Minors team-mates. The moment was captured by club photographer Stephen Niblett in December 2006 when the club were in League Two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000612927686.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in EFL</h2></p><p>Bowen — wearing a pair of glasses — is on the Meadow End terrace clad in the Hereford home shirt with his arms aloft.</p><p>The Hammers ace said: “From high-school age, there were a few of us that would go after school on a Tuesday when it was £1 to get in.</p><p>“There was a guy that was older who took us over.</p><p>“We’d go because where we were from, Hereford was the main attraction. They were our local team and being on the terraces at a young age isn’t as daunting as going to a big stadium. Edgar Street only holds 5,000.</p><p>“There was that enjoyment of watching the game with your mates, standing on the terraces. That’s what it’s like in the lower divisions.”</p><p>It has been warned EFL clubs could start going bust around Christmas if there is no financial bailout from the Premier League or Government — or fans are not allowed to return in some capacity.</p><p>And Bowen said: “Everyone wants the smaller clubs to stay in business. Lower-league football provides massive enjoyment for the population of England.</p><p>“Even an FA Cup game, when you get the giantkilling teams hosting Premier League clubs at their stadiums, that gives a proper buzz for those fans.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000612927710.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000612927815.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000612927677.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000612927689.jpg><p>Bowen, after an unsuccessful trial with Cardiff, joined the Bulls and made his senior debut in the National League against Barnet aged 17.</p><p>He can relate to how lower-league footballers and staff are worried about losing their livelihoods — as he was in a Hereford squad who did not get paid for six months before the club went to the wall.</p><p>Bowen said: “I was lucky because I was living at home and travelling to Hereford from my parents’ house.</p><p>“My only outgoing was a £30 train fare for the week to take me the 15-mile distance.</p><p>“I didn’t have anything to pay for but there were older lads who relied on that money, had kids, a mortgage — and they weren’t getting paid.”</p><p>It proved to be the final season of Hereford’s history — one that famously included Ronnie Radford’s wonder strike in their giantkilling of Newcastle in the 1972 FA Cup.</p><p>After Bowen featured in their last game of the 2013-14 season — a 2-1 win at Aldershot — the club were expelled from the National League and wound up in December 2014.</p><p>And he said: “Every one of the lads — and the fans, including me — was in freeze mode. We couldn’t believe what had happened.</p><p>Hopefully we’ll see Hereford back as an established Football League team once again</p><span class=quote-credit>Jarrod Bowen</span><p>“We had been playing in League One only a few seasons earlier against the likes of Leeds and Leicester.</p><p>“So we went from being an established <a href=#>EFL</a> side to staying up on the last day of the season in the National League but then being expelled and liquidated.”</p><p>Phoenix club Hereford FC have since formed and climbed three divisions to National League North.</p><p>And Bowen, who keenly follows their exploits, said: “They managed to keep the stadium and are on the rise. Hopefully we’ll see them back as an established Football League team once again.”</p><p>Bowen will always be indebted to Hereford and ex-manager Pete Beadle and assistant Steve Jenkins, who gave him his break.</p><p>He said: “It was the best thing I was involved in. The Premier League clubs have the youth set-ups but me being at a young age in National League football with fully grown men, some of whom had made hundreds of Football League appearances, matured me.</p><p>“I had a better understanding and felt a lot more at ease in that environment than being surrounded by youth-level footballers.</p><p>“When you’re in and around that <a href=#>old-school, non-league, head-it, kick-it football, you’ve got to be tough</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000612927819.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000613262133.jpg><p>“Having that experience definitely helped me when I made the transition to <a href=#>Hull</a>.”</p><p>Bowen spent five years at the KCOM Stadium and was a regular in the team for two-and-a-half seasons — scoring a staggering 52 goals in 112 league starts as a winger.</p><p>And he said: “When we got into the Premier League, I wanted to go on loan to get game time for my development but they wanted me to stay.</p><p>“That was frustrating on one hand but, on the other, training with Premier League players who had massive experience and were internationals helped me.</p><p>“When we got relegated I had two-and-a-half seasons playing in the Championship and loved every minute of it, playing games — that’s exactly what I needed.”</p><p>Bowen, now at West Ham after his <a href=#>£22million January move</a>, is on fire. He has netted three in the last two games — a <a href=#>4-0 win against Wolves</a> followed by a shock <a href=#>3-0 victory at Leicester</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>He said: “I scored a few in pre-season, giving me confidence. In the Arsenal game I had a few shots blocked then got my first brace against Wolves and scored in the Leicester game.</p><p>“Scoring in the Premier League is another box ticked off. Getting a full season will be good for me. Hopefully I can kick on and have many more years in the Premier League.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/d134f087-3f2d-470c-8a7f-bd194b869d05.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NINTCHDBPICT000612342286.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Ally McCoist can’t believe that Premier League clubs won’t financially help EFL clubs</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2Z%2FeYWUanBsZ5qWv7O7w2aZqK%2BVo3qpsdGenaiqlGKvtr%2FTZq6eq6RitaK5jKyYr51dpMKzecKlrJurXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjarrod-bowen-hereford-bust-west-ham-save-our-clubs.html&text=Jarrod%20Bowen%20recalls%20watching%20his%20beloved%20Hereford%20go%20bust%20as%20West%20Ham%20star%20backs%20The%20Sun%27s%20Save%20Our&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjarrod-bowen-hereford-bust-west-ham-save-our-clubs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjarrod-bowen-hereford-bust-west-ham-save-our-clubs.html&title=Jarrod%20Bowen%20recalls%20watching%20his%20beloved%20Hereford%20go%20bust%20as%20West%20Ham%20star%20backs%20The%20Sun%27s%20Save%20Our" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjarrod-bowen-hereford-bust-west-ham-save-our-clubs.html&title=Jarrod%20Bowen%20recalls%20watching%20his%20beloved%20Hereford%20go%20bust%20as%20West%20Ham%20star%20backs%20The%20Sun%27s%20Save%20Our" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjarrod-bowen-hereford-bust-west-ham-save-our-clubs.html&title=Jarrod%20Bowen%20recalls%20watching%20his%20beloved%20Hereford%20go%20bust%20as%20West%20Ham%20star%20backs%20The%20Sun%27s%20Save%20Our" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjarrod-bowen-hereford-bust-west-ham-save-our-clubs.html&description=Jarrod%20Bowen%20recalls%20watching%20his%20beloved%20Hereford%20go%20bust%20as%20West%20Ham%20star%20backs%20The%20Sun%27s%20Save%20Our" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sofia-richie-frankies-bikinis-campaign-photos-swimsuit-collection.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos From Her Collection  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dennis-l-via.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Dennis L.
