It's just like an emergency contact. It doesn't make me feel any different."&nbsp;</p><p>He then admitted he has not spoken to his twin girls in "eight years."</p><p><a href=#>Jon</a> said: "I text them every single year. And every time I come here to your show or interview, I text my daughter every single time."</p><p>He revealed that they have not "blocked him" because "it's blue."</p><p>Jon believed Cara might possibly be "angry and scared," because she does not want to "upset her mother.'</p><p>While talking about Mady, the TV star pointed out that Hannah "cut through stops" and had dinner with her and the other siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>Colin was not in attendance with them at the dinner.&nbsp;</p><h2>JON'S SUPPORT</h2><p>In the same Dr. Oz's interview, Jon revealed that he also keeps in touch with his ex-girlfriend Colleen and <a href=#>hasn't abandoned her during her battle with breast cancer</a>.</p><p>The Jon & <a href=#>Kate Plus 8</a> alum told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Oz</a>&nbsp;recently that he is still friends with Colleen Conrad, whom he dated for seven years before breaking up in August, and is there for her in her time of need.</p><p>Jon&nbsp;said: "I’ll always love Colleen. And we’re friends and it wasn’t because of cancer [that we broke up].</p><p>"I helped her through cancer, insurance and everything else. I supported her through her cancer. It was easier as friends to break off the relationship and get her through that as well."</p><p><a href=#>Colleen</a>, 51, was diagnosed with breast cancer in April.</p><p>Just a few months later, the&nbsp;<a href=#>couple called it quits</a>.</p><h2>PANDEMIC PROBLEMS</h2><p>At the end of 2020 Jon&nbsp;<a href=#>contracted COVID</a>&nbsp;and was hospitalized for 11 days. He also spent 47 days off work.</p><p>While he says Colleen was “super supportive,” he said the strain in their relationship only grew.</p><p>Then in February this year the worn down couple decided to call it a day.</p><p>Jon made plans to move from his home in Reading, Pennsylvania to Florida for a fresh start.</p><p>He recalled: "We decided to terminate our relationship,&nbsp;we were both ready."</p><p>“I made plans to ask Amazon for a transfer and I talked to the kids about moving, but in the end Hannah and Collin decided they wanted to stay in Pennsylvania for school, so ultimately we stuck around.</p><p>“Then we got to April and that’s when Colleen was diagnosed with cancer.”</p><h2>THE ESTRANGEMENT</h2><p>Kate and Jon have had an ongoing custody battle since their divorce in 2009 after spending 20 years together.</p><p>After years of going back and forth in court battles, the co-parents have currently split where their kids must live with either parent.</p><p>Four of the exes' 16-year-old sextuplets – Aaden, Joel, Alexis, and Leah – live with Kate and have&nbsp;<a href=#>moved with her to North Carolina</a>.</p><p>The other two, Collin and Hannah, 17, live with their father and will remain with him in Pennsylvania.</p><p>Mady&nbsp;and her&nbsp;<a href=#>twin sister Cara</a>&nbsp;were left out of the custody agreements as they are both legal adults and had headed off to college.</p><p>The timing of the breakup&nbsp;<a href=#>raised suspicions</a>, but in an exclusive interview with The Sun, Jon said the cancer diagnosis had nothing to do with the decision, insisting their relationship had become "fraught" during the coronavirus pandemic</p><p>"It's hard, it was a big decision. We have been together for seven years which is a long time, so it's very upsetting," he explained.</p><p>“It's really hard to even talk about it. When you're with someone that long, especially in the public eye and she's someone private.</p><p>"We had some struggles and we tried to push through them as best we could, but it didn't really work out the way we thought it would.</p><p>"I still love and care for Colleen but we've both determined that it’s the natural end.”</p><p>Jon confessed the unhappy pair split up more than once and even tried couple’s therapy in a bid to mend their issues.</p><p>But it took a pandemic to push them past the brink.</p><h2>THE HOLIDAYS</h2><p>Back in October, Collin, and Hannah got a jump ahead of the holiday season and made their Christmas lists already.&nbsp;</p><p>During his interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood Life</a>, the Jon & Kate Plus 8 star revealed the "interesting things" that Collin and Hannah had asked for, including a "new comforter."</p><p>He added: "They send their lists. They use apps. They add it to their Amazon cart which is ironic because I work for Amazon.</p><p>"They’ll send me 50 things so then I just pick through things. They send stuff like furniture. Who sends furniture in their Christmas list? It’s funny.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>While also gathering presents for Collin and Hannah, the TV star and his kids "like to donate to different charities as well.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jon pointed out: “I try to teach my kids that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000693042483.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000693042480-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000551054312-2.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Jon and Kate Gosselin’s daughter Mady, 21, goes PANTLESS in new TikTok video amid parents’ custody battle</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYGyFeH6YaKKarJViva3B0mZvZqWRmcZus86sqp6kmaN6pMHSraadsV2XrrXAy55knqukp66vs8SmnKesXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkate-plus-8-mady-gosselin-custody-battle-estrangement-photos.html&text=Jon%20and%20Kate%20Gosselin%27s%20daughter%20Mady%2c%2021%2c%20wows%20in%20short%20black%20dress%20after%20dad%20admits%20they%20haven%27t%20s&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkate-plus-8-mady-gosselin-custody-battle-estrangement-photos.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkate-plus-8-mady-gosselin-custody-battle-estrangement-photos.html&title=Jon%20and%20Kate%20Gosselin%27s%20daughter%20Mady%2c%2021%2c%20wows%20in%20short%20black%20dress%20after%20dad%20admits%20they%20haven%27t%20s" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkate-plus-8-mady-gosselin-custody-battle-estrangement-photos.html&title=Jon%20and%20Kate%20Gosselin%27s%20daughter%20Mady%2c%2021%2c%20wows%20in%20short%20black%20dress%20after%20dad%20admits%20they%20haven%27t%20s" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkate-plus-8-mady-gosselin-custody-battle-estrangement-photos.html&title=Jon%20and%20Kate%20Gosselin%27s%20daughter%20Mady%2c%2021%2c%20wows%20in%20short%20black%20dress%20after%20dad%20admits%20they%20haven%27t%20s" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkate-plus-8-mady-gosselin-custody-battle-estrangement-photos.html&description=Jon%20and%20Kate%20Gosselin%27s%20daughter%20Mady%2c%2021%2c%20wows%20in%20short%20black%20dress%20after%20dad%20admits%20they%20haven%27t%20s" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./zp35vhfm3gaexzx-f3b5gxq7qg0w3ety.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hassan-whiteside.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hassan Whiteside Celebrity Profile  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
