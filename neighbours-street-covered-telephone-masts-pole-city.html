So they will have been risk assessed for a range of scenarios, including those over which the resident has raised concerns."</p><p>MS3 added: "MS3, alongside other network constructors, the local council and MPs have been working on a voluntary charter to ensure best practise and minimise disruption.</p><p>"We remain in constructive dialogue with KCOM in regard to network sharing and will continue to strive for the best outcomes for the homes and businesses in our city.</p><p>"Along with normal operational repairs, both our build and operations teams are fully conversant for their recovery and repair strategy should any damages occur to the network."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Grain then said: "We understand that there is a lot of frustration in Hull about the impact of lots of new telegraph poles being installed on the street.</p><p>"We agree this is unnecessary. We have given a commitment to Hull council and the local MPs that Grain will never install a telegraph pole as part of our network deployment.
