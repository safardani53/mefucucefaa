Eight is the number he's been wearing since his childhood, when he was playing football in Oklahoma.</p><p>"All my life, that's the number I've always worn. The number, I feel like it brings something different out of me," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Josh said</a> in August 2023, per the Raiders' website. "Even in college, I feel like I took that leap in that number, so it's going to be fun to see what I can do with it. Try to make it a staple."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Josh elaborated by saying that he had always felt a special connection to that number. "Growing up, it was always just a number that I felt always caught my eye," Josh said. "I remember when I was in Little League, I got my jersey stolen. I had a 30s number and I was like, 'Man, nah.' But there's something about that 8 that makes me feel like a superhero."</p><p>In spite of the new number, Josh's teammates said he still looked like the same player, which is good news if you're as talented as Josh is.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"He looks like 8. I mean well he looks like 28, but he looks like 8," Brandon Bolden said at the time, per the Raiders' website. "Same old Josh. He was away from football, he missed, we missed him but we're back to work. Having him out there today, that was big for everybody out there – including him."</p><p>Apparently Josh had wanted to change his number the previous season, but learned he'd <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have to pay the NFL more than $3 million</a> to cover the rest of the inventory for his No. 28 jerseys. Needless to say, that didn't happen, and Josh decided to wait to change the number.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ain6i1brbAnKabq12YtaK6xp5koaGjYru2ucGeqQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-josh-jacobs-change-his-number.html&text=Why%20Did%20Raiders%20Running%20Back%20Josh%20Jacobs%20Change%20His%20Number%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-josh-jacobs-change-his-number.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-josh-jacobs-change-his-number.html&title=Why%20Did%20Raiders%20Running%20Back%20Josh%20Jacobs%20Change%20His%20Number%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-josh-jacobs-change-his-number.html&title=Why%20Did%20Raiders%20Running%20Back%20Josh%20Jacobs%20Change%20His%20Number%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-josh-jacobs-change-his-number.html&title=Why%20Did%20Raiders%20Running%20Back%20Josh%20Jacobs%20Change%20His%20Number%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-josh-jacobs-change-his-number.html&description=Why%20Did%20Raiders%20Running%20Back%20Josh%20Jacobs%20Change%20His%20Number%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./baskin-robbins-menu-german-choclate-ice-cream-back.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Baskin-Robbins brings back 58-year-old menu favorite and customers are wondering how they can get it">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./verivery-has-revealed-the-final-dates-and-locations-for-their-us-tour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Verivery Has Revealed The Final Dates And Locations For Their US Tour">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
