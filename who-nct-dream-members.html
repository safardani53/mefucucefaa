graduation system?</h2><p>When NCT started in 2016, it introduced <a href=#>K-pop</a> fans to a rotational graduation system.</p><p>Basically, NCT's members would leave the group after turning 20 years old to make room for fresh, young talent, according to <a href=# aria-label="NME (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">NME</a>.</p><p>Mark was the first member to "graduate," having left the group in December 2018, however, he was brought back in 2020, when the graduation system was scrapped.</p><p>“The graduation system was traumatic but we had to endure it and go on,”&nbsp;Mark told <a href=# aria-label="Rolling Stone UK (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone UK</a>.</p><p>“Coming back in, to be honest, I don’t think I was fully relieved [about it],” he continued.</p><p>“I didn’t know how everyone, including the fans, were going to react and I didn’t know how I should react. I felt like it might complicate things too much, but it also meant we could do something as 7Dream that we’d always dreamed of.</p><p>"It felt like the destiny of NCT DREAM kinda, y’know, took a turn.”</p><p>While Mark might've had his reservations, the NCT fanbase welcomed him back with open arms and they have since been able to enjoy music from all of their favorite NCT members.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/boy-band-nct-dream-performs-809724660.jpg><h2>Who founded NCT?</h2><p>Like most&nbsp;<a href=#>K-pop&nbsp;bands</a>, NCT was formed with several members who already had successful careers in their own right.</p><p>The band is also made up of members from all around the world and was first formed by South Korean business executive and SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Over the years, Soo-man has worked with several K-pop artists, including Super Junior, Girls’ Generation, SHINee, Red Velvet, SuperM, EXO, and Aespa, according to his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety500 biography</a>.</p><p>He also helped create the TV show K-Pop Goes Hollywood and messaging&nbsp;<a href=#>app</a>&nbsp;Dear U Bubble.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaGx9cYORaK6hp12jsLV5w6ucmqVdorKursSrqmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-nct-dream-members.html&text=Who%20are%20the%20NCT%20Dream%20members%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-nct-dream-members.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-nct-dream-members.html&title=Who%20are%20the%20NCT%20Dream%20members%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-nct-dream-members.html&title=Who%20are%20the%20NCT%20Dream%20members%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-nct-dream-members.html&title=Who%20are%20the%20NCT%20Dream%20members%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-nct-dream-members.html&description=Who%20are%20the%20NCT%20Dream%20members%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pierson-fodes-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Pierson Fode Dating  Pierson Fode's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vanderpump-rules-reunion-recap-scheana-reveals-new-bf-to-mike-sh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scheana Reveals New BF to Mike Shay ...
