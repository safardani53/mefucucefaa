There should be a police presence in that<br>underpass every night and drug dealers getting their doors kicked in.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"But it's been this way for months now. One of the dealers has his<br>number written on the wall so that the kids can get in touch and he'll<br>be down in two minutes."</p><p>Sure enough a mobile number is scrawled in marker pen on one of the lights that illuminates the tunnel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7581f694-e1c1-4c66-adde-b8180166c130.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/9a30cee0-2606-4e92-833f-7141a741949d.jpg><h2>Child poverty epidemic</h2><p>South Tyneside is one of the country's most deprived areas, with an<br>unemployment rate running at 6.5 per cent compared to the national average of 3.7 per cent.</p><p>The borough also has one of the UK's worst child poverty epidemics -<br>39 per cent of its young people are deemed to be living under the breadline, compared to the national average of 27 per cent.</p><p>Ian Driver, 58, sees the results of the grinding poverty faced by many<br>as CEO of Veterans Response, a charity aimed at helping servicemen and women in need.</p><p>He's also no stranger to antisocial behaviour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/e0a099e0-df63-4793-b8a1-90972cd89092.jpg><p>Ian said: "We've been here for 10 years and we're a vital service to<br>former services personnel who have nowhere left to turn.</p><p>"Some of them are on the streets and others can't afford to feed themselves.</p><p>"We run a foodbank which sees about 40 people coming for help every week. They fought for us, now we have to fight for them.</p><p>"We're really proud of what we do, everyone here is a volunteer, including me.</p><p>"So we were bloody furious to arrive for work to find the shutters of<br>our shop had been daubed with IRA graffiti.</p><p>"We've heard it was just a pair of drunks who thought it would be<br>funny, but what does that say about people's attitude?</p><p>"There is no respect for anybody or anything.</p><p>"You see it all over the town, people damaging property and issuing<br>threats, it's a huge problem.</p><p>"They should be rounded up and made to clear up the mess they've<br>created in high vis jackets that say, 'I am an offender'."</p><p>"I'd name them and shame them because the police don't seem to be able to do anything to put a stop to it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/70199b43-d1b9-431c-847d-a7cf5ee76f28.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ac-cop-car-pixellated-image.jpg><h2>Raiding Greggs for a snack</h2><p>His colleague Paul Boyle, 71, chips in: "Only this morning there were<br>kids raiding the Greggs up the road.</p><p>"They just go in and grab armfuls of food and run off with them, they don't fear being caught.</p><p>"At the bus station they break into the drivers' locker rooms and<br>pinch stuff out of there. It's so blatant."</p><p>William Quinn, 34, has returned to South Tyneside after 20 years living away.</p><p>He said: "One of the reasons I left was because of the drugs and the<br>gangs and now I'm back I've found it's changed - it's the street drinkers who are causing the problems.</p><p>"I understand that antisocial behaviour is a problem but you'll only<br>tackle that by getting to the root cause of it.</p><p>"A lot of the theft and shoplifting and begging is caused by people<br>who are committing crimes of desperation.</p><p>"We need to bring back a sense of community to the town and do<br>something to help the homeless and the people who are struggling so much they turn to petty crime."</p><h2>Repeat offenders</h2><p>In busy King Street, a constable responsible for town centre policing stops to chat.</p><p>The officer said: "Today is quite a good day, it's been quiet and I do<br>think we're making a difference here.</p><p>"We see motorcycle disorder at night - sometimes two or three kids riding through the town centre on one bike without helmets.</p><p>"Shoplifting is also an issue, often as a means of obtaining goods to<br>sell in order to buy drugs.</p><p>"We're seeing the same small group of offenders committing the<br>majority of the crime.</p><p>"They'll go to jail for a few weeks and it will go quiet but will start up again once they're released."</p><h2>Begging to survive</h2><p>Amid the charity shops and bargain stores of King Street, a homeless man unfurls his unwashed hands to reveal neat rows of £1 coins, his day's 'earnings' so far.</p><p>"On a good day I'll make £40 to £50," he says. "People here might not<br>have much but they're still generous enough to make sure I don't<br>starve."</p><p>Beggars like Lee, 34, get a special mention in the Government's<br>"action plan to <a href=#>crack down on antisocial behaviour</a>".</p><p>It aims to deliver <a href=#>police</a> "the tools to direct people causing a<br>nuisance on the street to the help they need".</p><p>Tackling antisocial behaviour in these areas was seen as a vital first<br>step in the process of regeneration.</p><p>But the homeless man disputes that his daily routine is causing anyone any issues.</p><p>He says: "I sleep on the street, I've no other choice. My place is<br>behind the B&M store at the back of the high street.</p><p>"I'm not bothering anyone, I've nowhere to live and I have to rely on<br>people's kindness to survive, it's as simple as that.</p><p>"This is not the life I want but people know me here and they look<br>after me and give me a bit of spare change so that I can get one<br>square meal a day.</p><p>"I still drink, I'm not going to lie about that, but my drink problem<br>is nowhere near what it used to be.</p><p>"There was a point where I was drinking two or three litres of vodka every day.</p><p>"I had a really difficult childhood, my mam was murdered when I was 13 and I went to pieces, totally off the rails and this is where I've<br>ended up.</p><p>"I know this area has its problems with unemployment and crime, but I don't think I'm adding to them."</p><h2>Night thieves</h2><p>It isn't only South Shields where the problems are evident.</p><p>On neighbouring Jarrow's Scotch Estate, Jessica Wingrove and boyfriend Mason Taws captured the latest attempt at stealing his motorbike on CCTV.</p><p>The thieves were unsuccessful, leaving behind bolt cutters they<br>planned to use to sever the security chain.</p><p>Although their bid failed - their second since the turn of the year -<br>the sight of their masked faces staring up at the security cameras has<br>proved unnerving for the young couple.</p><p>Jess said: "Personally I believe the police need to be more involved<br>in areas that are hit regularly and motorbike theft in particular<br>needs more police attention and a slap on the wrist if they are caught is not enough.</p><p>"Police patrols during the night would be helpful in areas like this.<br>We're utterly tired of this kind of behaviour."</p><p>A spokesperson for South Tyneside Council said: "One of the council’s five ambitions is to build strong communities where people feel safe and secure.</p><p>“Antisocial behaviour can have a serious detrimental impact on quality of life and we know that addressing it is something local people want us to prioritise.</p><p>“In direct response to residents’ concerns, there has been significant investment in community safety resourcing in the last year. New engagement officers will work alongside a business and community response team, targeting hotspot areas both proactively and reactively to resolve local issues.</p><p>"We have worked closely with the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner on a range of initiatives including seasonal diversionary youth work, which delivered a reduction in violent crime last summer. We have provided a youth outreach programme in support of a regional transport taskforce to put resources to tackle ASB on the public transport network.</p><p>"We have also developed a partnership protocol around canvassing of hotspot areas for motorcycle nuisance and using the intelligence to identify offenders and encourage reporting of incidents.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Antisocial behaviour is often complex and needs tackling collaboratively and holistically. We work hand-in-hand with the police and other partners, community groups and schools to take an early intervention and preventative approach as well as raising awareness about the consequences of anti-social behaviour and its effect on victims.</p><p>"Everyone deserves to feel safe where they live.&nbsp; We’d urge anyone who is experiencing or witnesses anti-social behaviour to report it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1cd9569c-23b5-4276-9a4a-5eb97d3dd5f0.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ355hZNpbW5no6TCtbSMrJ%2BinZyZwG7A2KecrKGUmnqxu9Weqa2xXZi%2FqrnEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsouth-shields-tyneside-poverty-crime.html&text=Our%20once-proud%20town%20is%20being%20ruined%20by%20drunks%20and%20addicts%20-%20criminals%20use%20brazen%20tricks%20but%20cops%20are&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsouth-shields-tyneside-poverty-crime.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsouth-shields-tyneside-poverty-crime.html&title=Our%20once-proud%20town%20is%20being%20ruined%20by%20drunks%20and%20addicts%20-%20criminals%20use%20brazen%20tricks%20but%20cops%20are" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsouth-shields-tyneside-poverty-crime.html&title=Our%20once-proud%20town%20is%20being%20ruined%20by%20drunks%20and%20addicts%20-%20criminals%20use%20brazen%20tricks%20but%20cops%20are" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsouth-shields-tyneside-poverty-crime.html&title=Our%20once-proud%20town%20is%20being%20ruined%20by%20drunks%20and%20addicts%20-%20criminals%20use%20brazen%20tricks%20but%20cops%20are" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsouth-shields-tyneside-poverty-crime.html&description=Our%20once-proud%20town%20is%20being%20ruined%20by%20drunks%20and%20addicts%20-%20criminals%20use%20brazen%20tricks%20but%20cops%20are" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shannen-dohertys-husband-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shannen Dohertys Husband: Who is Shannen Doherty Dating?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./max-boyd-e5pt-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Max Boyd (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
