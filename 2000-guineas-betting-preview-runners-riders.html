Or will the home team come out victorious with Godolphin, Martyn Meade and John Gosden all holding big hands?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000403706732-e1556797850825.jpg><h3>1. Advertise - Martyn Meade/Frankie Dettori (8-1)</h3><p>Martyn Meade's big Classic hope has only been beaten by two horses in five starts - Too Darn Hot and Calyx.</p><p>It does not take a genius to tell you that that form gives him huge claims.</p><p>The trip is the only worry. He's not bred to be anything bar a speedball and has always finished best over six furlongs.</p><p>But he's had a winter to mature and has always had this race lined up. Frankie will ease him through the early stages and they'll be plenty of cover with 19 set to go to post.</p><p>If he stays the trip effectively I think he has a huge chance.</p><h3>2. Al Hilalee - Charlie Appleby/William Buick (14-1)</h3><p>Was supplemented for this earlier in the week and heads here completely unexposed.</p><p>Won his maiden impressively at Newmarket, before winning a Listed race over a mile in France by a short head.</p><p>He must have shown some good signs at home for the boys in blue to stump up the cash.</p><p>Wouldn't be my pick but impossible to rule out.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Charlie Appleby on Al Hilalee</h3></p><p>"Al Hilalee took part in a racecourse gallop at Meydan nine days ago, and we were very pleased with him.</p><p>"I spoke with His Highness Sheikh Mohammed, and we decided that he would not be out of place in the 2000 Guineas.</p><p>"He flew into England on Sunday and travelled well. Having benefited from the winter sun, he looks very forward - in fact, he looks in rude health.</p><p>"We have always thought of him as a Derby prospect, and the plan has long been to run him at the Guineas Festival. So the decision to supplement was not a difficult one, now that we no longer have Quorto in the race, because the Guineas is one of the best Derby trials."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">LATEST IN RACING</h2></p><h3>3. Azano - John Gosden/Rab Havlin (66-1)</h3><p>A big price for a reason and has yet to kick on from his Yarmouth win.</p><p>His second in the Horris Hill behind Mohaather is still his best form and reads well, but he would still need to improve almost a stone from that top figure.</p><p>Failed to fire on his three-year-old debut despite being well-fancied and very hard to make a case for in this.</p><h3>4. Dark Vision - Mark Johnston/Joe Fanning (66-1)</h3><p>Was all the rage as a juvenile, winning his first three races like a serious racehorse.</p><p>Godolphin pulled out the old Dubai millions to have him run in the famous blue, before he flopped in the Champagne Stakes.</p><p>Showed he's still got ability with an eye-catching third at Chelmsford in April, but needs to kick on again.</p><p>He will be as fit as any in here and has a decent draw, so one of those at bigger odds that may need a second look.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Charlie Johnston, assistant, on Dark Vision</h3></p><p>"We are very pleased with him. A lot went wrong at Chelmsford, because the horses either side of him both gunned forward and took his ground.</p><p>"He met trouble up the straight but he only just got beat. It was good to get him back on the front foot after a really disappointing run at Doncaster. We were pretty certain that was not a true reflection of his form and ability, and I think that showed at Chelmsford.</p><p>"We would be hopeful of finishing in the first six."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000423962592.jpg><h3>5. Emaraaty Ana - Kevin Ryan/David Egan (40-1)</h3><p>Was very impressive when winning the Gimcrack on his third start. Less so in the Middle Park, but Ryan admitted he should not have run him.</p><p>Will relish conditions and up and coming David Egan is as good as any at easing horses into a race.</p><p>Unexposed - as are many in this - but has stamina to prove and will probably be seen to best effect over shorter this season.</p><h3>6. Great Scot - Tom Dascombe/Richard Kingscote (25-1)</h3><p>This horse has a big run in him and I'm hoping it could be the big field that brings it out of him on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>He often races too keenly for his own good and it's caught him out when upped in class.</p><p>His second in the Greenham was exactly the same and he still ran on for an encouraging second.</p><p>The big field should encourage a red hot pace up top, and that may be what Dascombe's bargain buy needs for his breakthrough victory.</p><h3>7. Kick On - John Gosden/Oisin Murphy (25-1)</h3><p>Likely to be one of the pace angles in the race and is drawn slap bang in the middle.</p><p>Has made all to win twice on the Rowley Mile already and if Murphy can get his fractions right he may be hard to pass.</p><p>However, he definitely lacks a gear change that some of his rivals have in the locker and the likes of Advertise and Ten Sovereigns will be looking for Murphy to tow him through the dip and into the final furlong.</p><p>An interesting angle into the race, and wouldn't put people off an each-way stab.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000483482143-e1556812750655.jpg><h3>8. King Of Change - Richard Hannon/Sean Levey (50-1)</h3><p>Broke his maiden tag a month back at Nottingham. Beat an exciting horse that day and improved from two juvenile efforts, but still not much to shout about at this level.</p><p>Unexposed, and this pair won the 1000 Guineas at a huge price last spring, but that is very much clutching at straws.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Richard Hannon on King Of Change</h3></p><p>"King Of Change really impressed us at Nottingham and has always been held in high regard, although running in the Guineas will be a big step up for him."</p><br><h3>9. Madhmoon - Kevin Prendergast/Chris Hayes (7-1)</h3><p>A fascinating contender and would be plenty shorter had he not been beaten at Leopardstown on his return.</p><p>You can fault him on the ground that day and he still showed enough promise after connections suggested he was far from fully revved up.</p><p>The draw is a concern; drawn on the far side, but with other big players such as Skardu and Ten Sovereigns close by, it doesn't look the end of the world.</p><p>At best over a mile, and the return to quick ground is a huge tick.</p><h3>10. Magna Grecia - Aidan O'Brien/Donnacha O'Brien (4-1)</h3><p>Part of the Ballydoyle one-two punch, but the complete opposite to stablemate, Ten Sovereigns.</p><p>Had been the favourite until it was announced Ryan Moore would ride Ten Sovereigns.</p><p>His Vertem Futurity win at Doncaster is solid form and he hit the line there like a proper miler.</p><p>Drawn nicely on the stands side and hard to find many flaws in him. O'Brien has a flawless record in this race and he is simply a huge player in this with Too Darn Hot on the sidelines.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Aidan O'Brien on Magna Grecia</h3></p><p>"We couldn't have dreamed of him doing any more (as a juvenile).</p><p>"The Guineas was always a possibility for him - that's why we went to Newmarket for his second run. He's very straightforward and seems to get the mile well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000444920504-e1556812803362.jpg><h3>11. Momkin - Roger Charlton/Seamie Heffernan (33-1)</h3><p>On paper looks a big price considering he was a neck second to Skardu in the Craven, who is around 7-1.</p><p>On a side note, I have no idea why stable jockey Jason Watson is not in the saddle.</p><p>But, hard to make a solid case for considering only one win in four starts and only one of those not in novice company.</p><p>Could run into a place but am happy to leave alone.</p><h3>12. Name The Wind - James Tate/PJ McDonald (50-1)</h3><p>Stinks of a horse with plenty of ability, but this may come a bit early in his career.</p><p>Has won both his starts narrowly, with plenty going wrong both times - but again that points to his inexperience.</p><p>Worth a go in this before he embarks on an exciting campaign, but hard to see him being in the frame when push comes to shove.</p><h3>13. Royal Marine - Saeed bin Suroor/Christophe Soumillon (8-1)</h3><p>Looks to be Godolphin's leading hope in the race, and would be plenty shorter had he run better in the Craven when given an absolute stinker of a ride.</p><p>Soumillon gets a chance for redemption here, and as a Group 1 winner he has to be feared.</p><p>One of a few in the field that would have preferred a bit of rain in the build up, but is drifting out to an attractive price.</p><p>Drawn in the middle and Soumillon will have plenty of options of who he follows.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Saeed bin Suroor on Royal Marine</h3></p><p>"Royal Marine is better than what he showed in the Craven Stakes.</p><p>"He was too keen that day, then was stuck in behind horses and couldn't find any room.</p><p>"He has come back from the run very well, did his last piece of work on Monday, and will run equipped with a hood for the first time - which should help him relax.</p><p>"I am sure that there will be a strong pace, which will suit him, and any rain that we happen to get over the next couple of days should also be in his favour."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">LATEST IN RACING</h2></p><h3>14. Set Piece - Hugo Palmer/Jim Crowley (16-1)</h3><p>Drifted like a barge before the Craven but travelled well before plugging on for third in decent fashion.</p><p>Still has plenty to find to be a player, but has only had three runs and Hugo Palmer has always talked this colt up in a big way.</p><p>A tongue-tie is put on for the first time, but the draw is far from ideal in four you would think.</p><p>Another runner where it's very hard to be bullish about, but you cannot write off.</p><h3>15. Shine So Bright - Andrew Balding/Silvestre De Sousa (25-1)</h3><p>Put together some decent form as a two-year-old without winning often, but started this season well with a hardy win under Silvestre De Sousa.</p><p>The pair made all over seven furlongs at the Craven meeting and this was the obvious next stop despite the stamina doubts connections already had.</p><p>Drawn well to try a repeat of making all up the rail and if anyone can, De Sousa can. This is a huge test though.</p><h3>16. Skardu - William Haggas/James Doyle (7-1)</h3><p>Two from two after he flew home late to land the Craven Stakes with punters piling on late.</p><p>The form of that race is still to be tested though, and Haggas has been cautious in the build up.</p><p>Still has a bit to prove at this level, but Haggas is a maestro and always keeps his cards close to his chest anyhow.</p><h3>17. Sporting Chance - Simon Crisford/Pat Cosgrave (66-1)</h3><p>Highly-tried after eleven starts and has yet to suggest he's anywhere near the level to win a Classic.</p><p>Would be one of the biggest shocks in racing history if he got up on the line.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Simon Crisford on Sporting Chance</h3></p><p>"He was very impressive when he won the Meydan Classic, which (Derby winner) Masar got beat in last year - but I don't think we can compare him to Masar yet.</p><p>"He is a very tough, willing and tenacious type of colt. He is going to have to run better than before to be a contender, but he is in a good spot."</p><h3>18. Ten Sovereigns - Aidan O'Brien/Ryan Moore (7-2)</h3><p>Smashed into favouritism after Moore got the call up. A fascinating contender.</p><p>Looked a serious sprinter as a juvenile but Ballydoyle seemed convinced that he'll get this trip.</p><p>If he's travelling sweetly a furlong out, he could be very, very hard to beat.</p><p>His Middle Park win was very impressive at the backend of last season, and while a polar opposite to his stablemate Magna Grecia, the pair could have this race between them.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Aidan O'Brien on Ten Sovereigns</h3></p><p>"He's done very well (over the winter). We were delighted with him last year - and he's a fine, big colt now.</p><p>"You can't be sure about the mile until he goes and does it, but we've been happy with him so far."</p><h3>19. Urban Icon - Richard Hannon/Urban Icon (20-1)</h3><p>Connections seem to really like this horse and he is interesting.</p><p>Drawn fine in the middle and Hannon knows what it takes to win these early season races.</p><p>Lacked a turn of foot in the Greenham and this stiffer test could be what helps him improve now.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Richard Hannon on Urban Icon</h3></p><p>"Urban Icon came out of the Greenham absolutely fine - and if he gets the fast ground that he needs I can see him running a really big race in the Guineas."</p><br><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Ruby Walsh Retires - Irish jockey announces retirement with immediate effect after thrilling win on Kemboy in Punchestown Gold Cup</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cISYcW9rbmZkf3F8j2aerqGemq60ecGeq62hnpx6sb7Er6Cer12nwq%2B6xKuqZqqZmbKzv44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2000-guineas-betting-preview-runners-riders.html&text=Saturday%27s%202000%20Guineas%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20trainer%20quotes%2c%20riders%20and%20odds%20for%20the%20fin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2000-guineas-betting-preview-runners-riders.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2000-guineas-betting-preview-runners-riders.html&title=Saturday%27s%202000%20Guineas%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20trainer%20quotes%2c%20riders%20and%20odds%20for%20the%20fin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2000-guineas-betting-preview-runners-riders.html&title=Saturday%27s%202000%20Guineas%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20trainer%20quotes%2c%20riders%20and%20odds%20for%20the%20fin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2000-guineas-betting-preview-runners-riders.html&title=Saturday%27s%202000%20Guineas%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20trainer%20quotes%2c%20riders%20and%20odds%20for%20the%20fin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2000-guineas-betting-preview-runners-riders.html&description=Saturday%27s%202000%20Guineas%20betting%20preview%3a%20Latest%20runners%2c%20trainer%20quotes%2c%20riders%20and%20odds%20for%20the%20fin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./stephanie-pratt-says-we-should-shoot-the-looters-amid-nationwide.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stephanie Pratt Urges Americans to &amp;quot;Shoot the Looters&amp;quot; Amid Nationwide Protests, is the Literal Wors">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./paul-schrader.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paul Schrader- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife, Ethnicity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
