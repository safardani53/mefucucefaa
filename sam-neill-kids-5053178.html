Sam has three kids who have lived their lives completely out of the spotlight. Read on to learn all the available information about Irish actor Sam Neill’s kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Sam-Neill-Kids-SS-embed1.jpg><h2>How Many Children Does Sam Neil Have?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Sam Neill’s kids were raised completely out of the limelight and did not follow their famous father’s footsteps into the filmmaking industry. Therefore, there is very little known about their lives. Although multiple outlets have reported that he has two kids, he has at least three. Sam has two adult children, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>: son <strong>Tim</strong>, who he welcomed with his former girlfriend, actress <strong>Lisa Harrow</strong>, and daughter <strong>Elena</strong>, who was born to his ex-wife, <strong>Noriko Watanabe</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>However, due to his social media activity, it’s clear he has at least one other child. Sam became a grandfather again in Nov. 2021, and it was neither Tim nor Elena’s child. The child belongs to <strong>Maiko Neill</strong>, whose <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> page is set to private. However, her husband’s page is not private, and Sam has tagged him in a handful of social media posts. Between Sam’s posts and Maiko’s husband’s posts, it’s clear she is the mother of the Peaky Blinder actor’s newest grandchild.</p><h2>Maiko Neill</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Maiko Neill’s age and profession are not known, but she seemingly supports the family business: Sam’s New Zealand winery, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Two Paddocks</a>. She has a link to a blog post from Two Paddocks’ website in her Instagram bio, which asks the winery’s staff to name their favorite songs. The blog post can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sam announced the birth of Maiko’s daughter via a Nov. 18, 2021 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post in which he cradled his new grandchild, as seen below. “The Love . I don’t put family on media stuff . Except when they’re brand new,” he began in the caption of the sweet post. “This is my brand new grandson <strong>Nahlo</strong> , the bestest boy, 2 weeks old. So chilled, no fuss . Just eats , sleeps and thinks about things . Parents blissed out , and everybody happy. Me particularly . The love…”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In Feb. 2023, Sam took to the ‘gram to share a photo of Nahlo with his dad, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sly Augustin</strong></a>. Sly has shared a few pics of his bundle of joy and tagged Maiko, proving the baby boy is theirs. In fact, in Nahlo’s birth announcement, Sly joked that Maiko “produced” their son as if the process were a movie production. “Introducing our Son … Nhalo (nah-low) Wilson Neill-Augustin,” he wrote alongside a photo of his first child on Nov. 7, 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“Beyond thankful for him. Beyond Happy to be a Father,” he continued. “Everything is so different now, Like the whole world changed the second he was born. Nothing will be the same again, it will be so much better. Greatful (sic) to know so many dope dad’s, you’ll all be hearing from me at some point”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>He concluded his heartfelt caption by revealing Nahlo’s birth date. “World Premier 29th October 22:52 …” he noted. “Directed by @maikoneill & @slyaugustin … Produced by @maikoneill …”.</p><h2>Elena Neill</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Once again, there is no solid information on Elena Neill due to her super private life and lack of public social media profiles. She gave birth to a little boy in 2013, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Express</a>. “I have recently had a new grandson. I say this almost as if it were a personal achievement, but grandchildren in truth are thrust upon you whether you like it or not,” the In The Mouth Of Madness actor wrote in a column for The Spectator, according to the outlet. “He seems a perfectly agreeable sort of chap, as babies go. He’s a quiet baby, and quietness is highly regarded in people that small. And in fact I admire it wherever I find it…”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“This boy’s grandmothers are in a complete lather over him, and are quite incapable of keeping their hands off the little tyke,” he reportedly continued. “I’m not big on baby cuddling as it happens… Anyway, this boy seems to be universally thought of as winsome. I have no idea about that, but I do like his general quietness. We sit and look at each other in companionable silence; he sucks on his pacifier and I on my 2008 Pinot (wine). I like to be quiet too.”</p><h2>Tim Neill</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>There have been no reports of Sam’s son, Tim, having a child. However, Sam seemed to reveal he has an older grandson named<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Felix McIntosh</strong></a> on Instagram. He raved about Felix’s work as a DJ in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two separate posts</a> from March 5, 2023, and called him “The Prop’s grandson”. Sam goes by “SamNeillTheProp” on Instagram, so it appears he was referring to himself as Felix’s grandfather.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KapGamlZ65rXnKopusZWVlgnR9lnFm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsam-neill-kids-5053178.html&text=Meet%20The%20Jurassic%20Park%20Actors%20Children%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsam-neill-kids-5053178.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsam-neill-kids-5053178.html&title=Meet%20The%20Jurassic%20Park%20Actors%20Children%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsam-neill-kids-5053178.html&title=Meet%20The%20Jurassic%20Park%20Actors%20Children%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsam-neill-kids-5053178.html&title=Meet%20The%20Jurassic%20Park%20Actors%20Children%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsam-neill-kids-5053178.html&description=Meet%20The%20Jurassic%20Park%20Actors%20Children%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./thai-cave-rescue-is-set-to-be-released-on-netflix-soon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Thai Cave Rescue Is Set To Be Released On Netflix Soon">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lisa-marie-presley-passed-away-at-the-age-of-54.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lisa Marie Presley Passed Away At The Age Of 54">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
