Chet delves into some of his life experiences in his new video, “The Truth About Growing Up As A Hanks.”&nbsp;He remembers being questioned about growing up with celebrity parents in a recent video he released. Chet stated:</p><p>“There are a lot of benefits, but it can be a little strange at times.”</p><p>While he would not desire a different life, Chet spoke about the difficulties of being Tom Hanks’ kid.</p><p>“My situation was made more problematic by the fact that, on top of being poisonous, I wasn’t even famous. I was simply the kid of someone famous, so I hadn’t done anything to merit any form of respect, and this earned me a lot of scorn.”</p><p>People would think of him as an “arrogant, entitled, pampered child,” according to the celebrity youngster. Chet considers himself to be “privileged” rather than “spoiled.” He stated it was almost hard to persuade people to abandon their preconceived opinions about him.</p><p>“It was exceedingly difficult to break through their defenses. So I experienced a lot of scorn, anger, and negativity since everyone was ready to detest my guts.”</p><p></p><p>He addressed the bullying he experienced as a child by saying:</p><p>“It was never directed at me. It was constantly behind my back in the form of s*** talking and gossip.”</p><p>The most unexpected discovery occurred when Chet insisted on not having a male hero to look up to as a child.</p><p>“I lacked a strong male role model to tell me, ‘dude, f*** these guys, they’re just envious of you.'”</p><p>Chet has struggled with rage problems throughout the years. It took him a long time to discover that “people’s opinion of someone is merely a mirror of themselves,” he said. He maintained, however, that he had changed his ways.&nbsp;He no longer copes with his “anger” and “resentment” by “self-destructing, pleasure-seeking via partying, drugs, booze, narcotics.” Instead, he is concerned with “becoming the best” person he can be.</p><h2>Everything you need to know about Tom Hanks’ family.</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Chet-Hanx-4.jpg alt="Chet Hanx" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Tom Hanks, 65, is the father of four children, two from his first marriage and two from his second and present marriage.
