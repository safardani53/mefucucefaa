Gradually, she shifted to working as a sports reporter.</p><p>Her elegant and assertive personality helped her to achieve a lot of prominence as a sports reporter.</p><p>She was also titled “The sexiest journalist” in the year 2009. By 2015 she had received enough fame and compliments from the audience regarding her appealing personality.</p><p>She later manifested a clothing brand named “Slow love,” which included selling and clothing.</p><p>She also established the business with her friends’ help, where she successfully sold beauty products, accessories, and many more online.</p><p>In 2016, the general public instigated her as a fashion show host, namely “Quiero Ser.” Here’s a video link that can explain more.</p><h2>Sara Carbonero | Personal Life</h2><p>Initially, during her struggling days as a sports reporter back in 2009, she met Iker Casillas. He is a well-known footballer from Spain.</p><p>2009 was the year Sara got all the fame regarding her personality, and it was also the year where Iker fell for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/saraaa.jpg><p>Sara and Iker were tied up in a significant relationship. She has two children with her husband. The Spanish journalist and Iker had a beautiful wedding filled with family, friends, and loved ones.</p><p>Although they shared a tight bond, the pair recently confirmed their separation after four years of marriage.</p><p>Since then, Sara has been linked with Spanish musician Pablo López.</p><p>A journalist named Saúl Ortíz broke the news that she might be romantically involved with Pablo. Furthermore, the musician is reportedly helping Carbonero through this rough patch in her life.&nbsp;</p><p>However, none of the two have confirmed their relationship, so it most likely might be a rumor as she is fresh out of a four-year marriage.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sara Carbonero | Rumors</h2><p>Suppose we are talking about a celebrity or a well-known personality, then there has to be a rumor. Similarly, Sara has had several stories about her boyfriends and stuff.</p><p>According to the public, once <a href=# rel=noopener>Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and his friend were having a conversation in the dressing room. Ronaldo made a bet.</p><p>A bet where the winner would be the one who approached Sara the first. And Ronaldo’s fellow mate was successful in approaching her first, so he started dating her. Rumors also say that they broke up before Valentine’s Day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Cristiano-Ronaldo-and-Sara-Carbonero.jpg><p>All these rumors were later taken back by Casillas when he talked about his excellent mate <a href=# rel=noopener>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, too tried to clear up later from his side to the general public, and as a result, everything went back to normal.</p><p>Both of them tried to clear up by telling the audience that those were all the unnecessary and rubbish rumors created by some stupid fellows.</p><p>After this, we hope Sara has stayed away from any other controversies.</p><h2>Sara Carbonero | Criticisms</h2><p>Sara was once exceedingly criticized by the audience as Iker Casillas lost Switzerland’s most important games.</p><p>This match was genuinely important to all the fellow fans of Casillas as well as the team. But unfortunately, the team lost it.</p><p>Many people blamed Sara for distracting Casillas, which was also considered one of the significant reasons that dwindled the young player’s focus in the match.</p><p>This created a huge effect on Sara, but she maintained her patience level and faced them all.</p><p>She was also strongly criticized, abused, and blamed for <a href=# rel=noopener>Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and his friend’s bet in the dressing room rumor.</p><p>Despite all these situations, Sara managed to handle them with her well-known calm attitude and well-settled patience.</p><p>She was called silly, stupid, and everything a girl would never like to hear. Sara didn’t speak a word.</p><p>But her husband could not bear all this, and as a result, Iker took down the rumors really soon; moreover, everything turned out to be normal again.</p><h2>Sara Carbonero | Battle with Cancer</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, in this beautiful journey, namely “life,” an individual must bear many impossible situations.</p><p>Sara has been through such a kind of concern too. She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sara-Carbonero-and-Iker-Casillas-1024x538.jpeg><p>No one had expected that this elegant lady, too, had to bear with something so dreadful. She looks soft and sensitive outside, but she proved herself a powerful and courageous woman after battling such a fatal disease.</p><p>She attended the chemos, surgeries courageously. Sara was brave enough to handle all of these.</p><p>She kept faith in herself and her family, and as a result, everything went well. Her surgeries and chemos were passed successfully. This L’oreal brand ambassador has been through a lot.</p><p>She still faces abusive words from her loving people, the public excessively criticizes her, she is body-shamed, people blame her for her husband’s loss in-game sometimes, and whatnot.</p><p>But this woman kept her head up and went through everything. She is a global personality today.</p><h2>Sara Carbonero | Appreciation</h2><p>This beautiful lady has faced criticisms, but she has also impressed the general public with her elegance and ability to handle challenging situations and stand for someone she cares about.<br>People appreciated for taking a stand for one of her colleagues when she was body-shamed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sara-carbonero-quits-smoking.jpg><p>There was a time when her colleague named “Tania Llasera” was habituated to smoking. Once, she decided to quit smoking.</p><p>After a few months, she posted a picture where she had gained abnormal weight due to her body’s sudden changes.</p><p>The picture she posted became a medium of trolls to a lot of people. A lot of the people badly trolled her.</p><p>People body-shamed abused and made fun of these girls in such a way that anyone would get ashamed of that.</p><p>Another friend of the L’Oreal ambassador named “Carme” was also body shamed for being too fat.</p><p>Carme possibly mentioned that when she’d been to a designer, the designer rejected making a dress for her and absurdly told her that she doesn’t make any dresses for women with a size of more than 36.</p><h2>Sara Carbonero | Awareness</h2><p>After all this, Sara’s boyfriend, Iker, added a picture of all the imperfections he had on his body. He posted this to people aware that everyone has faults. Flaws don’t make anyone ugly.</p><p>Iker proved it via Sara’s statements. Later, Sara, too, added a picture of her imperfection on the arm.</p><p>Sara posted a photo that showed pigmentation on her arm and a scar she had near an elbow. This lady later talked about body shaming and made a remarkable statement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sara4.png><p>“I support constructive criticism in any field, but I can’t understand those who slam people’s physical appearance,” she wrote.</p><p>Many people appreciated her statement, which slammed all those fellow people who trolled her beautiful colleagues unnecessarily.</p><p>These are the pictures where Sara revealed her imperfections.
